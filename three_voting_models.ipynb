However, if we assume that the $600 increase is added to her rent and utilities expenses instead of her income, then we can find her previous monthly income:\\n\\nR (previous) = 0.4 * P\\nR (current) = R (previous) - $200 (since rent didn't change) + $600 (the increase in utilities) = 0.25 * (P + $600)\\n\\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\\n\\n0.4 * P = 0.25 * (P + $600 + $200)\\nSimplifying and solving for P:\\n\\n0.4 * P = 0.25 * (P + $800)\\n1.6 * P = P + $800\\n$800 = 0.6 * P\\nP = \\frac{800}{0.6} = $1,333.33\\n\\nSo Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was approximately $1,333.33.</td>\n",

According to the problem, the ratio of their coins is 10:45, which can be written as 10x = 45y.\\n\\nWe also know that the total number of coins they have is 440. Since x and y represent the number of coins for Elsa and Amalie respectively, we can write this equation: x + y = 440.\\n\\nNow let's focus on how many coins Amalie will remain with after spending 3/4 of her coins on toys. Let's denote the number of coins she spends on toys as z. We know that Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins, so we can write this equation: y = z * (3/4).\\n\\nWe want to find out how many coins Amalie will remain with, which is given by the expression y - z. However, since we only have one equation that directly relates to x and y, we need to find a way to eliminate one variable. We can do this by using the ratio of their coins (10x = 45y).\\n\\nFirst, we'll solve for y in terms of x: y = (1/3) * 10x. Now, let's substitute y into the equation x + y = 440: x + [(1/3) * 10x] = 440\\n\\nSolving this quadratic equation will give us the value of x, and since y = (1/3) * 10x, we can find the value of y as well. Once we have both x and y, we'll be able to calculate z and then find the number of coins Amalie will remain with (y - z).\\n\\nLet's see if we can solve this equation: x + [(1/3) * 10x] = 440\\n\\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 3x + 10x = 1320\\n\\nCombining like terms, we have: 13x = 1320\\n\\nDividing both sides by 13, we find x = 102. Now we can calculate y and z:\\n\\ny = (1/3) * 10x = (1/3) * 10 * 102 = 340\\nz = y * (3/4) = 340 * (3/4) = 510.5\\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coin, let's round up to the nearest whole number: z = 511.\\n\\nFinally, let's find out how many coins Amalie will remain with: y - z = 340 - 511 = -171.\\n\\nIt appears that we made a mistake somewhere in our calculations since we ended up with a negative number. Let me double-check the steps to see if there's an error. I think the problem might have stated that Amalie spends \"3/4 of what she has on toys\" but it should have been \"3/4 of her coins are spent on toys,\" meaning that only 3/4 of her coins are available for spending, not that she spends 3/4 of each coin. In that case, the number of coins she spends on toys would be (3/4) * y = (3/4) * 340 = 259.\\n\\nNow let's try to find Amalie's remaining coins again with this assumption:\\n\\nThe total number of coins Elsa and Amalie have is 440, and Elsa has x = 102 fewer coins than Amalie. So Amalie must have x + 102 = 440 - x = 338 coins. Since Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys, the number of coins she spends on toys is z = (3/4) * 338 = 259.\\n\\nNow let's find out how many coins Amalie will remain with: y - z = 338 - 259 = 79.\\n\\nSo the correct answer is that Amalie will have 79 coins remaining.</td>\n",

Since we know that their total number of coins is 440, we have x + y = 440.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many coins Amalie has using the given ratio:\\nx : y = 2 : 9\\nx = 2 * (number of coins Amalie has)\\ny = 9 * (number of coins Amalie has)\\n\\nWe know that x + y = 440, so we can set up the following equation:\\n2z + 9z = 440, where z is the number of coins Amalie has.\\n\\nSolving this equation for z, we get:\\n11z = 440\\nz = 40\\n\\nSo, Amalie originally had 40 coins. Now, let's find out how many coins she spends on toys:\\nShe spends 3/4 of what she has on toys:\\nCoins spent on toys = (3/4) * 40\\n= 30\\n\\nTherefore, Amalie remains with:\\nNumber of coins left = Original number of coins - Coins spent on toys\\n= 40 - 30\\n= 10\\n\\nSo, Amalie will remain with 10 coins after spending 3/4 of them on toys.</td>\n",

This means that for every 11 coins that Amalie has, Elsa has 2 times that amount.\\n\\nThe total number of coins they both have is given as 440. Let's denote the common part of their coins as c:\\n\\nx + y = 440\\n\\nSince we know that Elsa's portion (x) is 10/55 or 2/11 the size of Amalie's portion (y), we can write an equation for x in terms of y:\\n\\nx = (2/11) * y\\n\\nNow we have two equations with two variables.

Also, keep in mind that these values are approximate due to the rounding.\\n\\nThe problem statement also mentions that Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys. Let's calculate how many coins Amalie spends on toys:\\n\\nCoins spent on toys = (3/4) * 327\\nCoins spent on toys = 231.25\\n\\nSince the number of coins must be an integer, we will round up to the nearest whole number: 232\\n\\nFinally, we need to find out how many coins Amalie will remain with after spending on toys:\\n\\nTotal coins - Coins spent on toys = Remaining coins\\n327 - 232 = 95\\n\\nTherefore, Amalie will remain with approximately 95 coins.</td>\n",

Each iron nickel is worth $3, so the total value of all iron nickels is 80 * $3 = $240\\n\\nSince Alice still has the remaining 80% of her nickels ($20), let's calculate their total value:\\n\\n1. The value of 320 regular nickels (400 - 80) is 320 * $0.05 = $16.\\n2.

Using the same logic as above, we need 3 gallons of water per inch for these fish: Number of fish = Total water volume / Water volume per fish = 32 gallons / 3 gallons/inch = 11 inches = 11 fish\\n\\nNow, let's find out how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank: 11 fish - 4 fish = 7 fish.\\n\\nHowever, since we don't know whether one of the first tank fish eats another fish or not, we cannot include that information in our answer. The given information only tells us about the number of fish and their sizes, but it doesn't mention anything about them eating each other.</td>\n",

In May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April. Half of the number of clips Natalia sold in April is:\\n\\nClips sold in May = Clips sold in April / 2\\n= 48 / 2\\n= 24\\n\\nSo, Natalia sold 24 clips in May. To find out how many clips she sold altogether in April and May, add the number of clips she sold in each month:\\n\\nTotal clips sold = Clips sold in April + Clips sold in May\\n= 48 + 24\\n= 72\\n\\nTherefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May.   \n",

We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\\n\\n50 minutes = 50 / 60 hours\\n= 0.83333333 hours (approximately)\\n\\nNext, we can calculate how much Weng earned for this amount of time by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours worked:\\n\\nEarnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked\\n= $12/hour * 0.83333333 hours\\n≈ $10.00\\n\\nSo, Weng earned approximately $10 for babysitting for 50 minutes.   \n",

We know they gave her $15.\\n\\nNext, we'll find out how much money Betty's grandparents gave her. Since they gave her twice as much as her parents, we can calculate this by finding half of the amount her parents gave her and then doubling that amount.\\n\\nParents' gift: $15\\nHalf of parents' gift: $15 / 2 = $7.50\\nGrandparents' gift: 2 * $7.50 = $15\\n\\nNow, we know Betty needs a total of $100 for the wallet, and she has already received $30 from her parents and grandparents ($15 from each). So we can find out how much more money she needs by subtracting the amount she has from the total cost of the wallet.\\n\\nTotal amount needed: $100\\nAmount received: $30\\nAmount still needed: $100 - $30 = $70   \n",

Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.\\n2. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages.\\n3. In total, she has read 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages.\\n4. The book is 120 pages long, so there are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to read.\\n5. Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, so she should read 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.

We have three equations based on the given information:\\n\\n1) Ten of each color: Yellow = 10, Purple = 1.2 * 10 = 12, Green = 0.25 * (Yellow + Purple) = 0.25 * (10 + 12) = 3.75 * 10 = 3.75 x 10\\n\\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a flower, the number of green flowers must be a multiple of 5 to make up for the difference between 3.75 and a whole number (for example, if there were 4 purple flowers instead of 5, there would be 0.8 fewer purple flowers, which would result in 9.6 yellow flowers, and we cannot have 9.6 yellow flowers). Let's assume Green = 5 * n.\\n\\n2) 80% more purple than yellow: Purple = 1.8 * Yellow\\n\\n3) 25% as many green as yellow and purple: Green = 0.25 * (Yellow + Purple)\\n\\nNow we have a system of equations:\\n\\nTen of each color: 10 = 10 +12+n*5\\n1.8 * Yellow = 12\\nGreen = n*5\\n\\nSolving the first equation, we get:\\n10 = 12 + n*5\\nn = -1.2 or 4.5\\nSince the number of flowers must be a whole number, we will consider the second solution, n=4.5 as an approximation and round up to get n=5. This would result in there being 1 less yellow flower than intended. However, since the percentages given do not add up to exactly 100%, it's reasonable that Mark's garden won't have an exact number of flowers according to the provided information.\\n\\nTherefore, our approximation is:\\nYellow = 10\\nPurple = 1.8 * 10 = 18\\nGreen = 5 * 5 = 25\\n\\nHowever, this results in a total of 53 flowers, which is 1 flower more than the number of yellow or purple flowers stated. To satisfy the given condition of having ten flowers of each color, we need to round down Yellow and Purple and add 1 extra Green flower:\\nYellow = 9\\nPurple = 18\\nGreen = 5 * 5 + 1 = 26\\n\\nSo, Mark has approximately 9 yellow flowers, 18 purple flowers, and 26 green flowers in his garden. The total number of flowers is around 53.   \n",

In total, he buys 32 + 16 = 48 pizza slices. Therefore, if Albert eats all of the pizza slices he bought in one day, he will consume a grand total of 48 pieces.   \n",

Initial weight: Ken placed an empty box on the scale.\\n2. Jelly beans (first addition): Ken added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So, the weight after this addition was 2 pounds.\\n3. Brownies (second addition): Next, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Tripling 2 pounds gives us 6 pounds. So, the weight after this addition was 6 pounds.\\n4. Jelly beans (third addition): He then added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, making the total weight 8 pounds.\\n5. Gummy worms (fourth addition): Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Doubling 8 pounds gives us 16 pounds.\\n\\nSo, the final weight of the box of goodies was 16 pounds.   \n",

The calculation above suggests she spent significantly more than her stated budget on the clothes. In reality, it's unlikely she had only $16 left after purchasing a full suit and accessories.   \n",

According to the problem, every next ship had twice as many people as the previous one. So, the number of people on the second ship was 2x, on the third ship was 2*(2x) = 4x, and so on.\\n\\nThe monster consumed a total of 847 people in three hundred years. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 4x + ... + 512x = 847\\n\\nNow, we need to find the sum of geometric series with first term x and common ratio 2. The formula for the sum of such a series is S = x*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where n is the number of terms and r is the common ratio. In our case, n = 511 (because there are 512 terms including the first one) and r = 2.\\n\\nS = x*(1 - 2^511)/(1 - 2)\\nS = x*(1 - 1073741824)/(-1)\\nS = -x + 1073741825\\n\\nWe know that the sum of our series should be equal to 847. So, we have:\\n\\n-x + 1073741825 = 847\\n-x = 1073741740\\nx = -1073741740\\n\\nSince the number of people cannot be negative, this result does not make sense. It seems that there is a mistake in the problem statement or in the way we approached it.   \n",

Shoe cost: $95\\n2. Monthly allowance: $5\\n3. Number of months saved: 3\\n4. Income from mowing lawns: $15 per lawn, 4 lawns mowed = $60\\n5. Income from shoveling driveways: $7 per driveway, unknown number\\n6. Change left after buying shoes: $15\\n\\nWe know that the total amount of money Tobias had before buying the shoes was $5 * 3 (monthly allowance for three months) + $60 (income from mowing lawns). So we can set up an equation:\\n\\n$5 * 3 + $60 = $95 + $15\\n\\nSolving this equation, we find that Tobias earned a total of $85 from his jobs. Since he had $15 in change after buying the shoes, he must have earned an additional $70 from shoveling driveways. To find the number of driveways he shoveled:\\n\\n$7 per driveway => Number of driveways = $70 / $7 = 10 driveways\\n\\nTherefore, Tobias shoveled 10 driveways to earn the extra money for his new shoes.   \n",

Randy has 60 mango trees.\\n2. He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many coconut trees there are:\\n1. Half as many mango trees: 60 * 0.5 = 30\\n2. Five fewer: 30 - 5 = 25\\n\\nSo Randy has 25 coconut trees.\\n\\nNow let's find the total number of trees on his farm:\\nTotal trees = Mango trees + Coconut trees\\n= 60 + 25\\n= 85\\n\\nTherefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.   \n",

The cost of 2 pounds of cheddar cheese is $10.\\n2. The pound of cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $5 (half of $10).\\n3. The pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $20 (twice $10).\\n4. To find the total cost, we add up the cost of each ingredient: $10 + $5 + $20 = $<b>$35</b>.\\n\\nSo Jasper spends a total of $35 on the ingredients for his charcuterie board.   \n",

Since the profit is shared in the ratio 2:5 between Mike and Johnson respectively, we can set up a proportion:\\n\\nMike's share : Mike's share (spent on a shirt) = 2 parts : 5 parts\\nLet x be the total profit:\\n\\n$200 (Mike's share spent on a shirt) : ($) = $2500 (Johnson's share) : $\\n\\nSetting up the proportion, we get:\\n\\n$200 : x = $2500 : 5x\\n\\nCross-multiplying, we have:\\n\\n2x * $200 = 5x * $2500\\n\\nSolving for x:\\n\\n2x = (5x)*($2500/$200)\\n2x = 12.5x*12.5\\n2x = 156.25x\\nx = -78.125x + 312.5\\nx = $312.5 + 78.125x\\n\\nSince we cannot have a negative number of shares, this equation implies that x is larger than 78.125 times the total profit. To keep things simple, let's assume the total profit ($312.5 + 78.125x) is greater than $6000 (Johnson's 5 parts).\\n\\nNow we can find Mike's share:\\n\\nMike's share = 2 parts out of 7 parts (total) = 2/7 * x\\n\\nTo get the amount before spending on a shirt, we subtract $200:\\n\\nMike's share before the shirt = 2/7 * x - $200.\\n\\nWe cannot find an exact numerical value for Mike's share without knowing the total profit, but we now have a formula to calculate it.\\n\\nHowever, since the profit is not specified and the equation implies that the profit should be greater than a certain value, there isn't enough information to determine the exact amount Mike will receive.   \n",

Carl took 4 pink hard hats, so there are now 22 pink hard hats remaining. John took 6 pink hard hats, so there are now 16 pink hard hats remaining.\\n\\nNext, let's find out how many green hard hats John took. He took twice as many as the number of pink hard hats he removed, so he took away 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 green hard hats.\\n\\nSo there are now 26 (original pink) - 4 (taken by Carl) - 16 (remaining after John took some) = <<26-4-16=4>>4 fewer pink hard hats in the truck, and 15 (original green) - 8 (taken by John) = <<15-8=7>>fewer green hard hats.\\n\\nHowever, we did not consider the yellow hard hats yet. There were originally 26 pink + 15 green + 24 yellow = <<26+15+24=65>>65 hard hats in the truck. We know that there are now fewer pink and green hard hats, but we don't know if there are also fewer yellow hard hats. Since nothing was mentioned about taking away any yellow hard hats, it is safe to assume that they remain unchanged.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is 22 pink + 7 green + 24 yellow = <<22+7+24=53>>53 hard hats.   \n",

He walks to work three times a week, and it takes him 2 hours for each walk. So, he spends 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours walking per week.\\n2. He rides his bike to work twice a week, and it takes him 1 hour for each ride. So, he spends 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 hours biking per week.\\n\\nNow let's find the total number of hours Roque spends getting to and from work every week:\\n\\nTotal hours per week = Hours spent walking + Hours spent biking\\nTotal hours per week = 6 hours + 2 hours = <<6+2=8>>8 hours.   \n",

Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.\\n2. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so she bought 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20 truck stamps.\\n3. She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since she bought 20 truck stamps, she bought 20 - 13 = <<20-13=7>>7 fewer rose stamps than that, which means she bought 20 + 13 = <<20+13=33>>33 rose stamps.\\n\\nTherefore, Bella bought a total of 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 33 (rose) = <<11+20+33=64>>64 stamps.   \n",

Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.\\n2. Each snake eats 3 birds per day.\\n3. Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.\\n4. There are 6 jaguars in the forest.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many birds each jaguar eats per day: Since one jaguar eats 5 snakes and each snake eats 3 birds, then one jaguar consumes 5 * 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 birds per day.\\n\\nNow that we know one jaguar eats 15 birds per day, let's find out how many beetles the jaguars eat collectively: Since each bird eats 12 beetles per day and there are 15 birds (each jaguar's food supply) consumed daily, then the total number of beetles eaten daily is 15 * 12 = <<15*12=180>>180.\\n\\nTherefore, in this forest, 180 beetles are eaten each day by all the animals.   \n",

We know that:\\n\\n1. y = x - 3 (Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's)\\n2. If Bobbie removes two letters from her last name, she has a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Let n be the number of letters in Jamie's last name (Grey, with 5 letters). Then x - 2 = 2n\\n\\nNow we have a system of equations:\\ny = x - 3\\nx - 2 = 2n\\n\\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for n:\\nn = (x-2)/2\\n\\nSince Jamie's last name has five letters, n = 5. So:\\n\\n5 = (x-2)/2\\nx = 7 or x = 13\\n\\nIf x = 7, then Samantha's last name would have y = 4 letters, which is not possible since Samantha's first name has more than one syllable. So, we take x = 13. Therefore:\\n\\ny = x - 3\\ny = 10\\n\\nSo, Samantha's last name has 10 letters.   \n",

We know that she spent $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday, so the total amount she has spent is:\\n\\n$15 + $23 = $38\\n\\nTherefore, Mary has used $38 of her $100 credit. To find out how much credit she needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we simply subtract the amount she has already spent from her credit limit:\\n\\n$100 (credit limit) - $38 (amount spent so far) = $62\\n\\nSo, Mary will need to pay $62 in order to reach her credit limit of $100 before her next shopping trip.   \n",

We know that he started with 175 tennis balls, so the number of balls he didn't hit is:\\n\\n* Total balls - Balls hit = Unhit balls\\n* 175 - 65 = <<175-65=110>>110 balls\\n\\nSo Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.   \n",

After the first round of deletion, he kept 30% (or 240 files) out of the initial 800 files he downloaded.\\n2. After the second round of deletion, he kept 2/5 (or 80%) of the files he downloaded in the second round. So, he kept 320 files out of the 400 files he downloaded in the second round.\\n\\nTo find the total number of valuable files left after both rounds of deletion, we add the number of valuable files from each round:\\n\\nTotal Valuable Files = Valuable Files (Round 1) + Valuable Files (Round 2)\\n= 240 files + 320 files\\n= 560 files.   \n",

The first four houses each have 3 gnomes in their gardens.\\n2. So, the total number of gnomes for the first four houses is 4 (houses) * 3 (gnomes per house) = 12 gnomes.\\n3. We know that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, so we need to find out how many gnomes are in the garden of the fifth house: 20 (total gnomes) - 12 (gnomes for houses 1 through 4) = 8 gnomes.\\n\\nTherefore, the fifth house has 8 gnomes in its garden.   \n",

We know that her rent and utilities expenses have decreased by $160 ($600 * 0.4 - $480 * 0.25), so:\\n\\ny = x + $160\\n\\nNow we can substitute y into the original equation:\\n\\n0.4 * x = 0.25 * (x + $160)\\n\\nTo solve for x, we first need to simplify the right side of the equation:\\n\\n0.25 * (x + $160) = 0.25 * x + 0.25 * $160\\n\\nNow we can compare the coefficients of x on both sides of the equation:\\n\\n0.4x = 0.25x + $40\\n\\nSubtracting 0.25x from both sides, we get:\\n\\n0.15x = $40\\n\\nDividing both sides by 0.15, we find:\\n\\nx = $266.67 (rounded to the nearest cent)\\n\\nTherefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was approximately $266.67.   \n",

Together they eat 4 pieces.\\n- Ann and Cate eat 75% of their pizzas, so each eats 3 pieces (three quarters of 4). Together they eat 6 pieces.\\n\\nNow let's find out how many pieces were bought in total:\\n- Each person buys one pizza, so there are a total of 4 pizzas bought. Since each pizza is cut into 4 pieces, there are a total of 16 pieces.\\n\\nNext, we can calculate the number of uneaten pieces:\\n- In total, 10 pieces were eaten (4 by Bill and Dale, and 6 by Ann and Cate).\\n- There were originally 16 pieces in total, so there are now 6 pieces left uneaten.   \n",

Since he sold twice as many paintings as last month, let's calculate that:\\n\\nNumber of large paintings this month = Number of large paintings last month * 2\\n                                              = 8 * 2\\n                                              = 16\\n\\nNumber of small paintings this month = Number of small paintings last month * 2\\n                                            = 4 * 2\\n                                            = 8\\n\\nNow that we know Noah sold 16 large paintings and 8 small paintings this month, we can calculate his total sales:\\n\\nTotal sales = (Price of one large painting * Number of large paintings) + (Price of one small painting * Number of small paintings)\\n           = ($60 * 16) + ($30 * 8)\\n           = $960 + $240\\n           = $1,200\\n\\nSo, Noah's sales for this month are $1,200.   \n",

We know that the total distance traveled around the ring is 23 meters. From the information given, we can construct the following equation:\\n\\n5 (first turn) + 8 (second turn) + x (third turn) + 0 (fourth turn) = 23 (total distance)\\n\\nSolving for x:\\n\\nx = 23 - 5 - 8 = 10 meters\\n\\nTherefore, the car had to travel 10 meters after the third turn.   \n",

We know that 40% of the students did not meet this mark.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate the number of students with a final grade below B:\\nNumber of students below B = Total number of students * Percentage below B\\nNumber of students below B = 60 students * 0.4\\nNumber of students below B = 24 students\\n\\nNow that we know there are 24 students below B, we can find the number of students above B by subtracting this number from the total student count:\\nNumber of students above B = Total number of students - Number of students below B\\nNumber of students above B = 60 students - 24 students\\nNumber of students above B = 36 students\\n\\nTherefore, Mr. Sanchez has 36 Grade 5 students who received a final grade of B and above.   \n",

Lisa earned half of the total earnings, so she earned $60 / 2 = $30.\\n2. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so he earned $30 / 2 = $15.\\n3. To find out how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy, subtract the amount that Tommy earned from the amount that Lisa earned: $30 - $15 = $15.\\n\\nTherefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.   \n",

Since each 6-ounce serving requires 2 ounces more than what her mom uses (6 oz vs. 4 oz or 1 oz), Artemis needs to use twice the amount of tea per person compared to what she uses for her mom's cup:\\n\\nTea needed per guest = Tea used per mom's cup * 2\\n= 1 oz * 2\\n= 2 oz\\n\\nNext, we calculate the total number of ounces of tea Artemis needs for all the guests at the party:\\n\\nTotal ounces of tea = Tea needed per guest * Number of guests\\n= 2 oz * 12\\n= 24 oz\\n\\nSo Artemis will need 24 ounces of tea for the party.   \n",

First, let's find out how many tickets Mr. Benson bought beyond the initial 10 tickets, which do not qualify for a discount. The difference is 12 - 10 = 2 tickets.\\n\\n2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets without any discount: $40 per ticket * 10 tickets = $400.\\n\\n3. Now, let's calculate the cost of the 2 discounted tickets: Each discounted ticket costs $40 - (5% of $40) = $38.20 ($38.00 rounded to the nearest cent is not applicable here since we don't have enough information).\\n\\n4. The total number of tickets Mr. Benson bought is 12, so the cost of all the tickets is: $400 (for the first 10) + ($38.20 * 2) (for the remaining 2) = $437.60.\\n\\nSo, Mr. Benson paid a total of $437.60 for all the concert tickets.   \n",

We know that each hand has 14 bananas, so we need to determine how many hands are there in total in both types of piles.\\n\\nPiles with 6 piles and 9 hands per pile:\\nNumber of banana hands = 6 (piles) * 9 (hands per pile) = 54 hands\\nTotal number of bananas = 54 hands * 14 bananas/hand = 768 bananas\\n\\nPiles with 12 hands, each having 9 bananas:\\nNumber of banana hands = 12 (piles) * 9 (hands per pile) = 108 hands\\nTotal number of bananas = 108 hands * 9 bananas/hand = 972 bananas\\n\\nNow, let's find the total number of bananas collected by the monkeys. The sum of bananas in both types of piles is:\\n\\nTotal bananas = 768 (pile 1) + 972 (pile 2) = 1740 bananas\\n\\nFinally, to find out how many bananas each monkey gets if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves, we simply need to divide the total number of bananas by the total number of monkeys:\\n\\nBananas per monkey = Total bananas / Total monkeys = 1740 bananas / 12 monkeys = 145 bananas/monkey (approximately)   \n",

In the first earthquake, four buildings collapsed.\\n2. Each subsequent earthquake causes twice as many collapsing buildings as the previous one.\\n3. So, in the second earthquake, 4 * 2 = 8 buildings collapsed.\\n4. In the third earthquake, 8 * 2 = 16 buildings collapsed.\\n5. To find out how many buildings collapsed in total, we add up the number of collapsing buildings from each earthquake: 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 buildings.   \n",

Now we can calculate how many minutes she practices in a month for each instrument:\\n\\nPiano minutes per month = Piano minutes per week * Weeks per month = 120 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 480 minutes/month\\nViolin minutes per month = Violin minutes per week * Weeks per month = 360 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1440 minutes/month\\n\\nNow we can calculate the total practicing time per month:\\n\\nTotal practicing time per month = Piano minutes per month + Violin minutes per month = 480 minutes/month + 1440 minutes/month = 1920 minutes/month.\\n\\nSo, Carolyn spends a total of 1920 minutes practicing piano and violin in a month with four weeks.   \n",

Sam memorized more digits than Carlos. Let's call the number of digits Carlos memorized \"c.\" Then Sam memorized c + 6 digits.\\n2. Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos, so she memorized 6 * c digits.\\n3. We know that Mina memorized 24 digits, so we have the equation: 6c = 24\\n\\nTo find out how many digits Sam memorized, let's first solve for c:\\n\\n1. From the equation 6c = 24, we can find c by dividing both sides by 6: c = 4\\n2. Since Carlos memorized 4 digits and Sam memorized 4 + 6 = 10 digits, Sam memorized a total of 10 digits.\\n\\nSo, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.   \n",

We know that Ben collected a third of what Laurie did, and Laurie collected 36 shells. So, Ben collected: 36 * (1/3) = 12 shells.\\n2. We also know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben. So, Alan collected: 4 * 12 = 48 shells.\\n\\nTherefore, Alan collected 48 shells during the school trip to the seashore.   \n",

So, in total, he spends $400 on baseball supplies each year. During the off-season, which is 8 months long (since there are 12 months in a year and Gerald's season is 4 months long), Gerald wants to save up enough money for his next year's baseball supplies.\\n\\nLet's calculate how much Gerald needs to save per month during the off-season:\\n\\n$400 (total annual cost of baseball supplies) / 8 (months in the off-season) = $50 per month (amount Gerald needs to save monthly)\\n\\nNow, we need to figure out how many chores Gerald needs to do each month on average to earn $50. He charges $10 per chore.\\n\\n$50 (monthly savings goal) / $10 (price per chore) = 5 chores per month (average number of chores required monthly)   \n",

The area of this rectangle is:\\n\\nArea_living_room = Length * Width\\nArea_living_room = 12 inches * 72 inches\\nArea_living_room = 864 square inches\\n\\nThe bedroom curtain is a rectangle with a length of 2 feet (or 24 inches) and a width of 4 feet (or 48 inches). The area of this rectangle is:\\n\\nArea_bedroom = Length * Width\\nArea_bedroom = 24 inches * 48 inches\\nArea_bedroom = 1152 square inches\\n\\nThe total amount of fabric Ann used is the sum of the areas for both curtains:\\n\\nTotal_fabric_used = Area_living_room + Area_bedroom\\nTotal_fabric_used = 864 square inches + 1152 square inches\\nTotal_fabric_used = 2016 square inches\\n\\nNow, we need to find out how much fabric is left on the bolt. The bolt of fabric has a length of 16 feet (or 192 inches) and a width of 12 feet (or 144 inches). The area of this rectangular piece of fabric is:\\n\\nArea_bolt = Length * Width\\nArea_bolt = 192 inches * 144 inches\\nArea_bolt = 27648 square inches\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate how much fabric is left by subtracting the total amount of fabric Ann used from the area of the bolt:\\n\\nFabric_left = Area_bolt - Total_fabric_used\\nFabric_left = 27648 square inches - 2016 square inches\\nFabric_left = 25632 square inches\\n\\nSo, Ann has 25,632 square inches of fabric left on the bolt.   \n",

Arnel started with ten boxes of pencils, and each box had the same number of pencils.\\n2. He kept ten pencils from one of the boxes for himself.\\n3. The remaining pencils were shared equally among his five friends.\\n4. Each friend received eight pencils.\\n5. To find out how many pencils were in the boxes initially, we first need to find out how many pencils Arnel and his friends had in total after sharing.\\n6. We know that Arnel kept ten pencils, so he had twenty pencils in total (ten from the shared boxes and ten that he kept).\\n7. His five friends each received eight pencils, so they had a total of 40 pencils between them.\\n8. Therefore, Arnel and his friends had a total of 60 pencils after sharing.\\n9. Since there were ten boxes originally, we can find the number of pencils in each box by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of boxes: 60 (total pencils) / 10 (boxes).\\n10. Solving this equation gives us that there are six pencils in each box.   \n",

First, let's find out how much money Leah had left after spending a seventh on the milkshake and putting half in savings. A seventh of her earnings is 1/7 * $28 = $4. She saved half, which is 1/2 * $28 = $14. So she had $28 - $4 - $14 = $10 left.\\n\\n2. However, her dog shredded all the money inside the wallet except for $1. Therefore, Leah lost $10 + $28 - $1 = $37.   \n",

We can do this by adding the number of roses, tulips, and daisies:\\n\\nTotal number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of tulips + Number of daisies\\n                       = 25 + 40 + 35\\n                       = 100\\n\\nNow we can find the number of flowers that are not roses by subtracting the number of roses from the total number of flowers:\\n\\nNumber of non-roses = Total number of flowers - Number of roses\\n                   = 100 - 25\\n                   = 75\\n\\nTo find the percentage of flowers that are not roses, we divide the number of non-roses by the total number of flowers and multiply by 100:\\n\\nPercentage of non-roses = (Number of non-roses / Total number of flowers) * 100%\\n                      = (75 / 100) * 100%\\n                      = 75%\\n\\nSo, 75% of the flowers in the garden are not roses.   \n",

The first part took him 25 minutes.\\n2. The second part took him twice as long as the first part, which is 2 * 25 = 50 minutes.\\n3. In total, Leo finished the first and second parts in 25 + 50 = 75 minutes.\\n4. He was supposed to finish the entire assignment in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\\n5. Therefore, we need to find out how long it took him to complete the third part of the assignment: 120 - 75 = 45 minutes.\\n\\nSo Leo finished the third part of his assignment in 45 minutes.   \n",

For chocolate chip cookies, she used one-half of her initial 10 kg: 10 kg * 1/2 = 5 kg\\n2. For peanut butter cookies, she used one-fifth of the remaining butter (after chocolate chip cookies): Let's find out how much butter was left after making chocolate chip cookies: 10 kg - 5 kg = 5 kg. Now she used one-fifth of this amount for peanut butter cookies: 5 kg * 1/5 = 1 kg\\n3. For sugar cookies, she used one-third of the remaining butter (after making chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies): Let's find out how much butter was left after making both types of cookies: 10 kg - 5 kg - 1 kg = 4 kg. Now she used one-third of this amount for sugar cookies: 4 kg * 1/3 = approximately 1.33 kg\\n\\nSo, Liza used a total of 5 kg (chocolate chip), 1 kg (peanut butter), and 1.33 kg (sugar) for making these three kinds of cookies. To find the remaining amount of butter, we subtract the amounts used from the initial quantity:\\n\\n10 kg (initial butter) - 5 kg (chocolate chip) - 1 kg (peanut butter) - 1.33 kg (sugar) = 2.67 kg\\n\\nSo, Liza has approximately 2.67 kilograms of butter left after making chocolate chip, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.   \n",

Since 2/3 of the students receive $6 allowance, we have:\\n\\nNumber of students receiving $6 allowance = (2/3) * Total number of students\\n= (2/3) * 60\\n= 40 students\\n\\nThe remaining students receive $4 allowance per day. So, the number of students receiving $4 allowance is:\\n\\nNumber of students receiving $4 allowance = Total number of students - Number of students receiving $6 allowance\\n= 60 - 40\\n= 20 students\\n\\nNow we can calculate the total amount of money these students receive each day. For students receiving $6 allowance, the daily income is:\\n\\nDaily income for students receiving $6 allowance = Number of students * Allowance per student\\n= 40 students * $6\\n= $240\\n\\nFor students receiving $4 allowance, the daily income is:\\n\\nDaily income for students receiving $4 allowance = Number of students * Allowance per student\\n= 20 students * $4\\n= $80\\n\\nSo the total amount of money these 60 students receive in a day is:\\n\\nTotal daily income = Daily income for students receiving $6 allowance + Daily income for students receiving $4 allowance\\n= $240 + $80\\n= $320.   \n",

We know that:\\n\\n1. The bear gained a fifth of its required weight from berries during summer, which is equal to W/5 pounds.\\n2. During autumn, it gained twice the amount it gained in summer from acorns, which is equal to 2 * (W/5) = 2W/5 pounds.\\n3. The remaining weight was gained from salmon, which is equal to W - (W/5 - 2W/5) = 3W/5 pounds.\\n\\nSince we don't have specific information about how much weight the bear gained by eating small animals, it's impossible to determine that number based on the given information.   \n",

L\\n\\nWe know that there are 14 cans with an unknown capacity. We already determined the capacity of 10 cans, so we can calculate the capacity of the remaining 4 cans by finding the total liters and dividing it by the number of cans:\\n\\nTotal liters = Liters in known cans + Liters in unknown cans\\n= 80 L + ? * ? L\\n\\nWe know that there are 290 liters in total, so we can set up an equation:\\n\\n290 L = 80 L + (Number of unknown cans) * (Capacity of each unknown can)\\n\\nTo find the capacity of each unknown can, we need to solve for that variable. Unfortunately, without additional information, it's not possible to determine a unique value for the capacity of each unknown can. We would need to know either the number of unknown cans or their capacity.   \n",

We know he mowed 16 lawns and charged $33 each:\\n\\nMoney earned from mowing lawns = Number of lawns * Price per lawn\\n= 16 * $33\\n= $528\\n\\nNext, let's find out how much money Lee made from tips. We know he had three customers who gave him a $10 tip each:\\n\\nMoney earned from tips = Number of tips * Tip amount\\n= 3 * $10\\n= $30\\n\\nFinally, we can add the money earned from mowing lawns and the money earned from tips to find out how much Lee earned in total last week:\\n\\nTotal earnings = Money earned from mowing lawns + Money earned from tips\\n= $528 + $30\\n= $558\\n\\nSo, Lee earned a total of $558 from mowing lawns last week.   \n",

Since she will be making 4 payments, her total installment cost will be: $65/month × 4 months = $260\\n\\nNow we can calculate the balance that Tara will have to pay after paying for 4 months of installments and making an additional down payment: $1020 (total cost) - ($20 (down payment) + $260 (installment payments)) = $780\\n\\nSo, her balance will be $780.   \n",

Since their average daily distance is approximately 3.62 miles, we calculate the difference:\\n\\nMiles remaining = Total miles - Miles run (in this case, 30 miles - 25.3333 miles) = 4.6667 miles\\n\\nNow, since there are three final days, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days to find their average daily distance over the last three days:\\n\\nAverage daily miles (last 3 days) = Miles remaining / Number of days\\nAverage daily miles (last 3 days) = 4.6667 miles / 3 days ≈ 1.56 miles per day (approximately)   \n",
       "68   Let's denote the number of coins Elsa has as x and the number of coins Amalie has as y. According to the problem, the ratio of their coins is 10:45, which can be written as 10x = 45y.\\n\\nWe also know that the total number of coins they have is 440. Since x and y represent the number of coins for Elsa and Amalie respectively, we can write this equation: x + y = 440.\\n\\nNow let's focus on how many coins Amalie will remain with after spending 3/4 of her coins on toys. Let's denote the number of coins she spends on toys as z. We know that Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins, so we can write this equation: y = z * (3/4).\\n\\nWe want to find out how many coins Amalie will remain with, which is given by the expression y - z. However, since we only have one equation that directly relates to x and y, we need to find a way to eliminate one variable. We can do this by using the ratio of their coins (10x = 45y).\\n\\nFirst, we'll solve for y in terms of x: y = (1/3) * 10x. Now, let's substitute y into the equation x + y = 440: x + [(1/3) * 10x] = 440\\n\\nSolving this quadratic equation will give us the value of x, and since y = (1/3) * 10x, we can find the value of y as well. Once we have both x and y, we'll be able to calculate z and then find the number of coins Amalie will remain with (y - z).\\n\\nLet's see if we can solve this equation: x + [(1/3) * 10x] = 440\\n\\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 3x + 10x = 1320\\n\\nCombining like terms, we have: 13x = 1320\\n\\nDividing both sides by 13, we find x = 102. Now we can calculate y and z:\\n\\ny = (1/3) * 10x = (1/3) * 10 * 102 = 340\\nz = y * (3/4) = 340 * (3/4) = 510.5\\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coin, let's round up to the nearest whole number: z = 511.\\n\\nFinally, let's find out how many coins Amalie will remain with: y - z = 340 - 511 = -171.\\n\\nIt appears that we made a mistake somewhere in our calculations since we ended up with a negative number. Let me double-check the steps to see if there's an error. I think the problem might have stated that Amalie spends \"3/4 of what she has on toys\" but it should have been \"3/4 of her coins are spent on toys,\" meaning that only 3/4 of her coins are available for spending, not that she spends 3/4 of each coin. In that case, the number of coins she spends on toys would be (3/4) * y = (3/4) * 340 = 259.\\n\\nNow let's try to find Amalie's remaining coins again with this assumption:\\n\\nThe total number of coins Elsa and Amalie have is 440, and Elsa has x = 102 fewer coins than Amalie. So Amalie must have x + 102 = 440 - x = 338 coins. Since Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys, the number of coins she spends on toys is z = (3/4) * 338 = 259.\\n\\nNow let's find out how many coins Amalie will remain with: y - z = 338 - 259 = 79.\\n\\nSo the correct answer is that Amalie will have 79 coins remaining.   \n",

We know that Martha has 68 apples.\\n2. Tim has 30 fewer apples than Martha, so he has 68 - 30 = 38 apples.\\n3. Harry has half as many apples as Tim, so he has half of 38, which is 38 / 2 = 19 apples.\\n\\nSo, Harry has 19 apples.   \n",

So, let's calculate the final volume:\\nVolume of fully filled aquarium = Length * Width * Height\\n4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = 21.6 cubic feet\\n\\nSince Nancy tripled the initial volume (which was 14.4 cubic feet), we can find the additional volume by multiplying the initial volume by three:\\nAdditional Volume = Initial Volume * 3\\n14.4 cubic feet * 3 = 42.96 cubic feet\\n\\nThe total volume of water in the aquarium is the sum of the initial and additional volumes:\\nTotal Volume = Initial Volume + Additional Volume\\n14.4 + 42.96 = 57.36 cubic feet (approximately)   \n",

In this case, there are 13 players, 3 coaches, and 2 helpers:\\n\\nTotal number of people = Players + Coaches + Helpers\\nTotal number of people = 13 + 3 + 2\\nTotal number of people = 18\\n\\nNow, divide the total number of people by the number of people each pack serves to find out how many packs Roger needs. Each pack serves 6 individuals:\\n\\nNumber of packs = Total number of people / Number of people per pack\\nNumber of packs = 18 / 6\\nNumber of packs = approximately 3\\n\\nSince he cannot buy a fraction of a pack, Roger will need to buy at least 4 packs to ensure there is enough trail mix for everyone. Therefore, Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix.   \n",

First, we know that the total weight lost by all four people is 103 kg.\\n2. We also know that the first person lost 27 kg and the second person lost 27 kg - 7 kg = 20 kg. So, the first two people together lost 47 kg (27 kg + 20 kg).\\n3. Since the total weight loss was 103 kg, we can find the weight lost by the last two people by subtracting the weight lost by the first two people from the total weight lost: 103 kg - 47 kg = 56 kg.\\n4. Therefore, each of the last two people lost a total of 56 kg / 2 = 28 kg.\\n\\nSo, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms of weight.   \n",

Then, the number of peppers is 2x. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of vegetables produced:\\n\\nTotal_vegetables = Potatoes + Cucumbers + Peppers\\n                             = 237 + x + 2x\\n\\nTo find the total number of vegetables, we need to simplify this expression and solve for x:\\n\\nTotal_vegetables = (1 +2) * x + 237\\n                             = 3x + 237\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the information given about cucumbers:\\n\\n1. The garden produced 60 fewer cucumbers than expected.\\n2. Let y represent the expected number of cucumbers. Then, the actual number of cucumbers is x = y - 60.\\n\\nSince we don't know the exact value of y (the expected number of cucumbers), it's impossible to determine the total number of vegetables produced based on the given information alone.

Since there are 2 months between the current month (4 months from the fight) and the day of the fight, the boxer will lose a total of 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kg before the fight.\\n\\nTherefore, the boxer will weigh 97 kg - 6 kg = <<97-6=91>>91 kg on the day of the fight.   \n",

We have Manny, 24 classmates, and one teacher, so there are 25 people in total.\\n\\nEach cookie pie is cut into 10 slices, and each person gets 1 slice. So, for 25 people to have 1 slice each, we need:\\n\\n25 people * 1 slice/person = 25 slices\\n\\nSince there are 3 cookie pies, the total number of slices is:\\n\\n3 pie * 10 slices/pie = 30 slices\\n\\nHowever, since all 25 people got their 1 slice each, we need to find out how many slices are left:\\n\\n30 slices (total) - 25 slices (used) = 5 slices\\n\\nSo, there are 5 slices left.   \n",

We know that Jennifer bought 40 cans initially.\\n2. For every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought an additional 6 cans.\\n3. Mark purchased 50 cans.\\n\\nFirst, let's determine how many extra cans Jennifer bought based on Mark's purchases:\\nExtra cans Jennifer bought = Number of can sets Mark bought * Additional cans per set\\n= (Number of can sets Mark bought) * (6 additional cans per set)\\n\\nTo find the number of can sets Mark bought, we divide the total number of cans he bought by the size of each set (5 cans):\\nNumber of can sets Mark bought = Total cans Mark bought / Cans per set\\n= 50 cans / 5 cans/set\\n= 10 sets\\n\\nNow we can calculate how many extra cans Jennifer bought:\\nExtra cans Jennifer bought = 10 sets * 6 additional cans/set\\n= 60 cans\\n\\nFinally, we add the initial number of cans Jennifer bought to the extra cans she bought based on Mark's purchases:\\nTotal cans Jennifer brought home = Initial cans + Extra cans\\n= 40 cans + 60 cans\\n= 100 cans\\n\\nSo Jennifer brought home a total of 100 cans of milk.   \n",

Round 1: Jeff skipped 1 less than Sam, and Sam skipped 16 times. Therefore, Jeff skipped 15 times (16-1).\\n2. Round 2: Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam, and Sam skipped 16 times. Therefore, Jeff skipped 13 times (16-3).\\n3. Round 3: Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam, and Sam skipped 16 times. Therefore, Jeff skips 20 times (16+4).\\n4. Round 4: Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam. Since Sam skpped 16 times in each round, Jeff completed 8 skips in this round (16/2).\\n5. To find the average number of skips per round for Jeff, we'll calculate the total number of skips he made throughout all four rounds and divide it by the number of rounds.\\n   Total skips by Jeff = 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56\\n   Average skips per round = Total skips / Number of rounds = 56 / 4 = 14\\n\\nHowever, we made an error in our initial calculation for Round 4. Jeff actually completed half the number of skips as Sam in that round, which is:\\n\\nHalf the skips of Sam in the last round = 16 / 2 = 8 skips\\n\\nSo the average number of skips per round for Jeff is indeed 14, but it was due to an error in our calculation for Round 4. The correct answer for Round 4 should be 8 skips instead of 14.   \n",

The hotel has 10 floors.\\n2. Each floor has 10 identical rooms, except for the last floor which is unavailable.\\n3. So, there are 10 rooms on each of the first through ninth floors (a total of 90 rooms).\\n4. Therefore, Hans can be checked into any of these 90 rooms.   \n",

We know two things from the problem:\\n\\n1) The cost of one ounce of soda is $0.25, so the total cost of x ounces is $0.25x.\\n2) Peter brought $2 to the store and left with $1.50, meaning he spent $0.50 on the soda. So we have the equation: $0.25x = $0.50.\\n\\nTo find x (the number of ounces), we need to solve this equation:\\n\\nStep 1: Divide both sides by $0.25:\\nx = $0.50 / $0.25\\nx = 2 * $0.25 / $0.25\\nx = 2\\n\\nHowever, this solution does not make sense because if Peter bought only 2 ounces of soda and each ounce costs $0.25, then the total cost should be $0.50 (as stated in the problem). But Peter left with only $1.50, meaning he must have bought more than 2 ounces. Let's try to find an integer solution that fits the constraints of the problem.\\n\\nStep 2: Check if there are any other integer solutions for x:\\nLet's see if there is a multiple of 5 or 10 in $2 that could be the number of ounces and still leave $0.50 change:\\n- $1.75 (3 ounces) works: $2 - $0.25 (first soda) - $1.50 (second soda) = $0.25 (change)\\n- There is no other multiple of 5 or 10 in the given constraints that works because 3 ounces is the smallest integer solution.\\n\\nSo, Peter bought 3 ounces of soda.   \n",

So, the number of books he borrows on Fridays is: 40 books * 1.4 (since 100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4 times the daily average) = 56 books\\n\\nTherefore, in a week (Monday to Friday), Krystian borrows:\\n(Number of books borrowed on an average day * 5 days) + (Number of books borrowed on Fridays) = 250 books\\n\\nSo, Krystian borrows approximately 250 books in a week.   \n",

We know that there are approximately 30-31 days in each of these winter months (December, January, and February), so:\\n\\nCups per month = Cups per day * Days per month\\n= 1 cup * (30 or 31)\\n= 30 or 31 cups\\n\\nFinally, we can find the total amount of food Herman needs by multiplying the number of cups he uses in one month by the number of months:\\n\\nTotal cups = Cups per month * Months\\n= 30 or 31 cups * 3\\n= 90 or 93 cups\\n\\nTherefore, Herman will need either 90 or 93 cups of food for all three winter months.   \n",

We can then calculate their total savings in a year based on the number of days in a year.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how much they save per day:\\n\\nSally's daily savings = Earnings per day * Percentage saved\\n                    = $6 * 0.5\\n                    = $3\\n\\nBob's daily savings = Earnings per day * Percentage saved\\n                   = $4 * 0.5\\n                   = $2\\n\\nNext, we'll calculate their total savings in a year. Assuming there are 365 days in a year:\\n\\nSally's annual savings = Daily savings * Number of days\\n                     = $3 * 365\\n                     = $1,195\\n\\nBob's annual savings = Daily savings * Number of days\\n                    = $2 * 365\\n                    = $730\\n\\nSo, Sally will have saved $1,195 and Bob will have saved $730 for their trip at the end of the year.   \n",

However, 20% of these are iron nickels worth $3 each. So let's find out how many iron nickels she has:\\n\\nNumber of iron nickels = Total number of nickels * Percentage of iron nickels\\n= $5 * 0.2\\n= $1\\n\\nSince one iron nickel is worth $3, we can now determine the value of this single iron nickel in terms of regular nickels:\\n\\n$3 = Number of iron nickels * Value of one regular nickel\\n=> Number of iron nickels = $3 / $0.05\\n=> Number of iron nickels ≈ 60\\n\\nSince Alice has only one iron nickel, this means that the remaining nickels must be regular nickels:\\n\\nTotal number of regular nickels = Total number of nickels - Number of iron nickels\\n= $5 / $0.05 - 1\\n≈ 98\\n\\nNow we can find out the total value of all the regular nickels:\\n\\nTotal value of regular nickels = Number of regular nickels * Value of one regular nickel\\n= 98 * $0.05\\n= $4.90\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate the total value of Alice's money by adding the values of both the iron nickel and the regular nickels:\\n\\nTotal value of money = Total value of iron nickel + Total value of regular nickels\\n= $3 + $4.90\\n≈ $7.90\\n\\nTherefore, after exchanging her 20 quarters for nickels, Alice now has approximately $7.90 worth of coins.   \n",

So, we need to find X first: X = Total number of books on bottom section of cart / 2.\\n\\nTotal number of books on bottom section of cart = (Number of mystery books) + 5 Western novels + 6 biographies\\n\\nSo, we have: X = (5 +5+6)/2 = 7.5 * 2 = <<7.5*2=15>>15\\n\\nNow that we know there are 15 mystery books on the bottom of the cart, Nancy shelved half of them = <<15/2=7.5>>7.5, which rounds up to 8 books. So, she shelved 8 mystery books from the bottom section.\\n\\nTotal number of books from the bottom section = 8 mystery books + 5 Western novels + 6 biographies = <<8+5+6=19>>19 books\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of books Nancy had on the cart when she started was: 24 books (from top) + 19 books (from bottom) = <<24+19=43>>43 books.   \n",

So, the number of inches of water in the second tank is equal to its volume in gallons.\\n\\nInches of water in the second tank = 24 gallons * 1 inch/gallon = 24 inches\\n\\nNumber of two-inch fish in the second tank = Inches of water / Inch per fish = 24 inches / 2 inches/fish = 12 fish\\n\\nNext, let's calculate how many inches and gallons of water are in the first tank:\\n\\nVolume of the first tank = 48 gallons\\nSize of the first tank = Volume of the first tank / Gallons per inch (for three-inch fish) = 48 gallons / 3 gallons/inch = 16 inches\\n\\nNow let's determine how many three-inch fish can be kept in the first tank:\\n\\nNumber of three-inch fish in the first tank = Inches of water / Inch per fish = 16 inches / 3 inches/fish = approximately 5.33 fish. Since we cannot have a fraction of a fish, let's round up and assume there are 6 three-inch fish in the first tank.\\n\\nFinally, to find out how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank, subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank:\\n\\nDifference in the number of fish = Number of fish in the first tank - Number of fish in the second tank\\n                                = 6 (three-inch) fish - 12 (two-inch) fish\\n                                = -6 fish\\n\\nSince the result is negative, it means that Gail has fewer fish in the first tank than in the second tank. However, the question asks for \"how many more\" fish are in the first tank, so if we assume that the error was a typo and the question meant to ask for the difference between the number of fish in the first and second tanks with the given conditions, then the answer is:\\n\\nGail has 6 fewer fish in the first tank than in the second tank.   \n",

Betty needs a total of $100 for the new wallet.\\n2. She currently has $50 ($15 from her parents and an unknown amount from her grandparents).\\n3. Her grandparents are giving her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her $15 * 2 = $30.\\n4. Therefore, Betty has a total of $50 + $30 = $80.\\n5. She still needs to save an additional $100 - $80 = $20 to reach her goal.\\n\\nSo, Betty still needs to save an extra $20 to buy the wallet.   \n",

Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.\\n2. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages.\\n3. The total number of pages in the book is 120. After reading 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages, Julie has 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to read.\\n4. She wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. So she needs to read 84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages tomorrow.\\n\\nTherefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow if she wants to read half of the remaining pages.   \n",

Ten flowers are yellow.\\n2. There are 80% more purple flowers than there are yellow flowers. So, if there are ten yellow flowers, then there would be 1.8 * 10 = <<1.8*10=18>>18 purple flowers.\\n3. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined.\\n   - We have 10 yellow flowers and 18 purple flowers, so together they make 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.\\n   - Then, we have 25% of that number for green flowers, which would be 0.25 * 28 = <<0.25*28=7>>7 green flowers.\\n\\nSo, in total, Mark has 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 7 (green) = <<10+18+7=35>>35 flowers in his garden.   \n",

Ken started with an empty box, so its weight is zero. He added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So, the weight of jelly beans is 2 pounds.\\n\\n2. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Since the weight was previously 2 pounds, tripling it results in a weight of 2 x 3 = 6 pounds for the brownies.\\n\\n3. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, making the total weight 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 pounds.\\n\\n4. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. Since the weight was previously 10 pounds, doubling it results in a weight of 10 x 2 = 20 pounds for the gummy worms.\\n\\nTherefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 10 + 20 = 30 pounds.   \n",

Therefore, we have:\\n\\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\\n\\nCombining like terms, we get:\\n\\n6x = 847\\n\\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to solve for x:\\n\\nx = 141.17 (approximately)\\n\\nSince the number of people must be an integer, we need to round up or down to find the closest possible value. In this case, if we round down to 140, then the total number of people consumed would be less than 847, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, we should round up to 142.\\n\\nSo, there were approximately 142 people on the first ship.   \n",

So we know that before buying the shoes, he had $95 + $15 = $110.\\n\\nLet's find out how much money he earned from mowing lawns:\\nHe mowed 4 lawns and earns $15 for each lawn, so he earned $15 x 4 = $60 from mowing lawns.\\n\\nNow let's find out how many driveways he shoveled:\\nWe know that Tobias has a total of $110 and he earned $60 from mowing lawns, so we can calculate the amount he earned from shoveling driveways:\\n$110 (total money) = $60 (mowed lawns) + $x (shoveled driveways)\\nWe're given that Tobias has $15 in change after buying the shoes, so the difference between his total earnings and what he had before spending the money on the shoes must be equal to $15:\\n$110 - $60 = $15\\n\\nSolving for x:\\nx = $110 - $60 - $15\\nx = $40\\n\\nSince Tobias charges $7 to shovel a driveway, we can find out how many driveways he shoveled:\\n$40 (earned from shoveling) / $7 (price per driveway) = ≈5.71 drives\\n\\nHowever, since Tobias can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we'll round this number down to the nearest whole number:\\n\\nTobias shoveled ≈6 - 1 = 5 driveways.   \n",

Since there are 60 mango trees, there will be 5 fewer trees for each pair, making it a total of 120 trees in the mango orchard (60 x 2).\\n4. Now we can find out how many coconut trees there are by subtracting the number of mango trees from the total number of trees:\\n\\nTotal number of trees = Number of mango trees + Number of coconut trees\\n120 (total number of trees) = 60 (mango trees) + X (coconut trees)\\nX = 120 - 60\\nX = 60\\n\\nSo, Randy has 60 coconut trees on his farm. Therefore, the total number of trees he has in all is:\\n\\nTotal number of trees = Mango trees + Coconut trees = 60 + 60 = 120 trees.   \n",

Cold cuts: cost twice the price of cheddar, so $2.50 * 2 = $5.\\n\\nNow let's add up the costs to find out how much Jasper spends in total: $2.50 (cheddar per pound) * 4 (pounds of cheddar) + $1.25 (cream cheese) + $5 (cold cuts) = $13.75.\\n\\nSo, Jasper spends a total of $13.75 on the ingredients for his charcuterie board.   \n",

Let X be the total profit from the business transaction.\\n2. According to the ratio, Mike gets 2/7 (or approximately 28.57%) of the total profit, and Johnson gets 5/7 (or approximately 71.43%).\\n3. We know that Johnson received $2500, so we can set up an equation to find X:\\n   5/7 * X = $2500\\n   Solving for X: X = ($2500 * 7) / 5 = $4133.33 (rounded)\\n4. Mike's individual share is then: 2/7 * X = $2066.68 (rounded)\\n5. However, we know that Mike spent an additional $200 on a shirt. So his actual take-home amount will be: $2066.68 - $200 = $2046.68 (rounded).\\n\\nTherefore, Mike will receive approximately $2047 after the transaction when accounting for his clothing expense.   \n",

Roque rides his bike to work for one hour each time, and he does this twice a week. So the number of hours he spends biking to work per week is 1 hour/day * 2 days/week = 2 hours/week.\\n\\n3. To find the total number of hours Roque spends getting to and from work each week, we add the number of hours he spends walking and biking: 6 hours (walking) + 2 hours (biking) = 8 hours/week.   \n",

She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so she bought 20 - 13 = <<20-13=7>>7 less rose stamps than truck stamps. To find out how many rose stamps she bought, we need to know how many truck stamps she bought.\\n4. From the information given, we don't have enough data to determine the exact number of truck and rose stamps Bella bought, as there are two variables (truck and rose) but only one equation involving them (rose = truck - 13).\\n\\nTherefore, without more information, it is impossible to determine how many stamps Bella bought in total.   \n",

Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.\\n\\n2. Each snake eats 3 birds per day, so each snake eats 3 × 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 birds per day.\\n\\n3. Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, so each jaguar eats 5 × 36 = <<5*36=180>>180 snakes per day.\\n\\n4. There are 6 jaguars in the forest, so they eat a total of 6 × 180 = <<6*180=1080>>1,080 snakes per day.\\n\\n5. Each snake eats 36 beetles per day (3 birds), so the jaguars together consume 1,080 × 36 = <<1080*36=39488>>39,488 beetles per day.\\n\\nTherefore, the forest's inhabitants eat a total of 39,488 beetles each day.   \n",

We know that Bobbie's last name has two fewer letters than Samantha's last name.\\n2. Bobbie took two letters off her last name, leaving it with the same number of letters as Jamie's last name (Grey, which has 5 letters).\\n3. Therefore, Samantha's last name must have 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 letters.\\n4. Since Bobbie's last name has three fewer letters than Samantha's, Bobbie's last name must have 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 letters.\\n\\nSo the answer is that Samantha's last name has 7 letters.   \n",

We know that she spent $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday, so the total amount she has spent is $15 + $23 = $<<15+23=38>>38.\\n\\nSince Mary's credit limit is $100, and she has already spent $38, she needs to pay an additional amount equal to $100 - $38 = $<<100-38=62>>62 before her next shopping trip.   \n",

First, we need to determine how many tennis balls Ralph didn't hit from each group.\\n2. From the first 100 tennis balls, he didn't hit 100 - (5/6 * 100) = 100 - 83.33 ≈ 16.67 * 100 = 167.33 ≈ 16 tennis balls.\\n3. From the next 75 tennis balls, he didn't hit 75 - (1/3 * 75) = 75 - 25 = 50 tennis balls.\\n4. To find out how many tennis balls Ralph didn't hit in total, we add the number of missed balls from each group: 16 + 50 = 66 tennis balls.\\n\\nHowever, we loaded the machine with 175 tennis balls initially. Therefore, Ralph hit a total of 175 - 66 = 109 tennis balls.   \n",

We know that the seawater contains 20% salt.\\n\\nFirst, let's convert the volume of seawater into kilograms:\\n2000 ml = 2 m³ (since 1 L = 1000 ml and 1 m³ = 1000 L)\\n2 m³ * 1000 kg/m³ = 2000 kg\\n\\nNow, let's find out how much salt is in the seawater:\\nSalt mass = Total mass * Salt percentage\\nSalt mass = 2000 kg * 0.2\\nSalt mass = 400 kg\\n\\nSince we want to know the volume of salt, we need to convert the mass back into volume:\\nDensity of seawater = 1025 kg/m³\\nVolume of salt = Mass / Density\\nVolume of salt = 400 kg / 1025 kg/m³\\nVolume of salt ≈ 0.389 m³ (≈ 389 L)\\n\\nTo convert this volume into milliliters, we multiply it by 1000:\\nVolume of salt = 0.389 m³ * 1000 ml/m³\\nVolume of salt = 3890 ml\\n\\nSo, Jack will get approximately 3890 ml (3.89 L) of salt when all the water evaporates.   \n",

In the second round, he deleted 3/5ths (or 72%) of the 400 new files he downloaded, leaving him with 120 files. Altogether, after deleting the unrelated files from both rounds, Brennan was left with 280 valuable files (160 from the first round + 120 from the second round).   \n",

We know that there are 5 houses, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in their gardens.\\n2. So, the number of gnomes in the first four houses is: 4 houses * 3 gnomes/house = 12 gnomes\\n3. We're told that there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, so we need to find out how many gnomes are in the fifth house.\\n4. To do this, we subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total number of gnomes: 20 gnomes (total) - 12 gnomes (first 4 houses) = 8 gnomes\\n5. Therefore, the fifth house has 8 gnomes in its garden.   \n",

We know that 40% of P went towards rent and utilities, which is now 25% of her current monthly income, which is P + $600.\\n\\nLet R be the amount she spends on rent and utilities per month. So we have:\\n\\nR = 0.4 * P (for her previous income)\\nR = 0.25 * (P + $600) (for her current income)\\n\\nWe can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for P:\\n\\n0.4 * P = 0.25 * (P + $600)\\n1 * P = 1 * P + 0.25 * $600\\nP = P + 0.25 * $600\\nP - P = 0.25 * $600\\n-0.25 * $600 = P\\nP = -\\frac{1}{4} * $600\\n\\nSince we cannot have a negative income, it looks like there's an error or missing information in the problem. However, if we assume that the $600 increase is added to her rent and utilities expenses instead of her income, then we can find her previous monthly income:\\n\\nR (previous) = 0.4 * P\\nR (current) = R (previous) - $200 (since rent didn't change) + $600 (the increase in utilities) = 0.25 * (P + $600)\\n\\nSubstituting the first equation into the second:\\n\\n0.4 * P = 0.25 * (P + $600 + $200)\\nSimplifying and solving for P:\\n\\n0.4 * P = 0.25 * (P + $800)\\n1.6 * P = P + $800\\n$800 = 0.6 * P\\nP = \\frac{800}{0.6} = $1,333.33\\n\\nSo Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was approximately $1,333.33.   \n",

Each person bought one personal pan pizza, so there were a total of 4 pizzas purchased. Since each pizza is cut into 4 pieces, there were a total of 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 pizza pieces.\\n2. Bill and Dale ate 50% of their pizzas, which means they ate 1 pizza between the two of them (since 1 pizza is equal to 2 x 2.5 = 5 pizza pieces).\\n3. Ann and Cate ate 75% of their pizzas, which means they ate 3 pizzas between the four of them (since 3 pizzas are equal to 4 x 3/4 = 3 pizza pieces each).\\n4. In total, they ate 1 + 3 = <<1+3=4>>4 pizzas, leaving 12 pizza pieces uneaten (since there were originally 16 pizza pieces and 4 have been eaten).\\n\\nSo, Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale left 12 pizza pieces uneaten.   \n",

We know that 16 cups of flour require 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt.\\n\\nSo,\\nNumber of teaspoons of salt = (Number of cups of flour) * (1/2)\\n= 16 * (1/2)\\n= 8 cups of salt\\n\\nSince there are 3 teaspoons in a cup, we need to convert the number of cups to teaspoons.\\n\\nTotal teaspoons of salt = 8 * 3\\n= 24 teaspoons\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of ingredients needed:\\n\\nTotal cups of water = 10\\nTotal cups of flour = 16\\nTotal teaspoons of salt = 24 (converted from 8 cups)\\n\\nTherefore, Kimber needs a combined total of 30 cups (10 + 16 + 4) of water, flour, and salt to make the pizza.   \n",

We know that Ken received $1750, so we can write an equation to represent the amount each son received:\\n\\nKen's share = $1750\\nTony's share = 2 * Ken's share\\n\\nSince Tony received twice as much as Ken, we can find Tony's share by multiplying Ken's share by 2. Now, we have two expressions for the total amount of money X:\\n\\nX = $1750 (Ken's share)\\nX = 2 * $1750 (Tony's share)\\n\\nWe can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for X:\\n\\n$1750 = 2 * $1750\\n\\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\\n\\n$1750 = $3500 / 2\\n\\nSolving for X:\\n\\nX = $3500\\n\\nSo the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony is $3500.   \n",

We know that 40% of Mr. Sanchez's students did not meet this benchmark.\\n\\nFirst, calculate the number of students with a final grade below B:\\n60 students * 40% = 24 students\\n\\nNow, subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many students have a final grade of B or above:\\n60 students - 24 students = 36 students\\n\\nSo, Mr. Sanchez has 36 Grade 5 students who achieved a final grade of B or higher.   \n",

Lisa earned half of the total earnings, which is 1/2 * $60 = $30.\\n2. Jack and Tommy earned the other half, which is also $30 combined ($60 / 2).\\n3. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so his earnings are 1/2 * $30 = $15.\\n4. To find the difference in earnings between Lisa and Tommy, we subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings: $30 - $15 = $15.\\n\\nTherefore, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.   \n",

To find out how much tea Artemis needs for a 6-ounce cup, we can set up a proportion:\\n\\n1 oz : 8 oz = x oz : 6 oz\\n\\nCross-multiplying, we get:\\n\\nx = 1 * 6 / 8 * 1\\nx = 3 / 4 * 6\\nx = 1.5 * 6\\nx = 9 oz\\n\\nSo, Artemis needs 9 oz of tea for a 6-ounce cup of tea for one person. To find the total amount needed for all 12 guests, we simply multiply the required tea for one serving by the number of guests:\\n\\nTotal tea required = 9 oz * 12 guests\\nTotal tea required = 108 oz (or 105 cups if rounding down to whole cups)\\n\\nTherefore, Artemis will need 108 ounces of tea for the party.   \n",

Piles with 6 piles and 12 hands (72 hands): Each hand has 9 bananas, so there are 72 * 9 = <<72*9=648>>648 bananas in these piles.\\n\\nNow let's find the total number of bananas: 788 + 648 = <<788+648=1436>>1,436 bananas.\\n\\nSince there are 12 monkeys in the family, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find out how many bananas each monkey gets: 1,436 / 12 = <<1436/12=119.66666666667>>119.67 bananas per monkey.\\n\\nHowever, since monkeys cannot have a fraction of a banana, each monkey would get approximately 120 bananas (rounding down from the result).   \n",

The first earthquake caused 4 buildings to collapse.\\n2. The second earthquake caused 2 * 4 = 8 buildings to collapse (since there were predicted to be double the number of collapsing buildings as in the previous earthquake). So far, we have 4 + 8 = 12 collapsed buildings.\\n3. The third earthquake caused 2 * 8 = 16 buildings to collapse. Now we have 12 + 16 = 28 collapsed buildings.\\n\\nSo, after three more earthquakes, a total of 28 + 4 = 32 buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake.   \n",

We know it is three times as long as her piano practice session:\\n\\nMinutes spent practicing violin per day = 20 minutes * 3 = 60 minutes\\n\\nSince Carolyn practices six days a week, we can calculate how many minutes she spends practicing in a week:\\n\\nMinutes spent practicing per week = (Minutes spent practicing piano per day + Minutes spent practicing violin per day) * Days per week\\n                                             = (20 + 60) * 6\\n                                             = (80) * 6\\n                                             = 480 minutes\\n\\nNow, to find out how many minutes she spends practicing in a month with four weeks, we multiply the weekly practice time by the number of weeks in a month:\\n\\nMinutes spent practicing per month = Minutes spent practicing per week * Weeks per month\\n                                              = 480 * 4\\n                                              = 1920 minutes\\n\\nSo Carolyn spends 1920 minutes practicing piano and violin in a month with four weeks.   \n",

Sam memorized more digits than Carlos, and he memorized 6 more digits.\\n2. Mina memorized 6 times as many digits as Carlos did.\\n3. Mina memorized 24 digits of pi.\\n\\nWe know that the difference between the number of digits Sam memorized and the number of digits Carlos memorized is 6. And we also know that Mina memorized 6 times as many digits as Carlos. So, we can set up two equations:\\n\\n1) Sam = Carlos + 6\\n2) Mina = Carlos * 6\\n\\nFrom the third piece of information given, we know that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi. We can find out how many digits Carlos memorized by dividing the number of digits Mina memorized by 6 (since she memorized 6 times as many as Carlos):\\n\\nCarlos = Mina / 6\\n\\nSubstituting the value of Mina from the third piece of information, we get:\\n\\nCarlos = 24 / 6\\nCarlos = 4\\n\\nSo, Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi. Using the first equation, we can find out how many digits Sam memorized:\\n\\nSam = Carlos + 6\\nSam = 4 + 6\\nSam = 10\\n\\nTherefore, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi (which is actually less than he originally memorized more than Carlos by 6 digits, but that's a mistake in the original problem statement). However, since we cannot have Sam memorizing fewer digits than before, there seems to be an inconsistency or error in the given information.   \n",

We know that Ben collected a third of what Laurie collected, so Ben collected 36 * (1/3) = 12 shells.\\n2. We also know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did, so Alan collected 4 * 12 = 48 shells.\\n\\nTherefore, Alan collected 48 shells during the school trip to the seashore.   \n",

Arnel started with ten boxes of pencils, and each box had the same number of pencils.\\n2. He kept ten pencils for himself, so he had a total of ten + 10 = 20 pencils.\\n3. Then, he shared the remaining pencils equally among his five friends. Each friend received eight pencils, so Arnel gave away 5 * 8 = 40 pencils.\\n4. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we first need to know how many pencils were originally in each box before Arnel took ten for himself. Let x be the number of pencils in one box. Then, the total number of pencils Arnel had at the beginning was 10x.\\n5. After giving away his ten pencils and sharing the rest with his friends, he had 20 pencils left. So we can set up an equation: 10x = 20 + 40 (the pencils he gave away)\\n6. Solving for x, we find that x = (20 + 40) / 10 = 60 / 10 = 6 pencils per box.\\n\\nSo, there are six pencils in each box.   \n",

First, we need to find out how much money Leah had left after saving a half of it. She earned $28, spent a seventh on a milkshake ($28 * 0.14 = $3.92), and saved half of the rest ($28 - $3.92 = $13.06). So, she had $13.06 + $1 = $14.06 left.\\n2. However, her dog shredded all but $1 of that money. Therefore, Leah lost $14.06 - $1 = $13.06.   \n",

Leo finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes.\\n2. It took him twice as long to finish the second part, so he spent 2 * 25 = 50 minutes on the second part.\\n3. In total, Leo has spent 25 + 50 = 75 minutes on the first and second parts of his assignment.\\n4. We're told that he was able to finish his entire assignment in 2 hours or 120 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\\n5. To find out how long it took Leo to finish the third part, we need to subtract the time he spent on the first and second parts from the total time given: 120 - 75 = 45 minutes.\\n\\nSo, Leo finished the third part of his assignment in 45 minutes.   \n",

Sugar cookies: Let's assume there was initially x kilograms of butter left after making chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies; then, x * 1/3 is used for sugar cookies.\\n\\nNow we have the following equations:\\n\\n5 kg + 2 kg + x = 10 kg\\n\\nSolving this equation, we get:\\n\\nx = 3 kg\\n\\nTherefore, Liza has 3 kilograms of butter left after making chocolate chip, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.   \n",

Calculate the total amount of money these students receive each day.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many students receive each allowance:\\n- Total number of students surveyed = 60\\n- 2/3 of the students receive $6 allowance per day => (2/3) * 60 = 40 students\\n- The rest of the students receive $4 allowance per day => 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 * 60 = 20 students\\n\\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money each group receives daily:\\n- Students receiving $6 allowance per day = $6 per student per day * 40 students = $240 per day\\n- Students receiving $4 allowance per day = $4 per student per day * 20 students = $80 per day\\n\\nFinally, let's calculate the total amount of money all students receive each day:\\nTotal daily allowance = $240 (from $6 allowance group) + $80 (from $4 allowance group) = $320.\\n\\nTherefore, the total amount of money those 60 middle school students get in a day is $320.   \n",

In the next three hours, she collected 35 coins each hour (for a total of 105 coins). However, she gave away 15 coins in the fourth hour. Therefore, the number of coins she had after the fourth hour is:\\n\\nCoins after 4 hours = Coins collected during the 4th hour + Coins remaining from the previous hours\\n= 50 coins - 15 coins (given to coworker) + 105 coins (collected in the first three hours)\\n= 66 coins\\n\\nSo, Joanne had 66 coins after the fourth hour.   \n",

However, if you have a specific value for W, you could calculate the difference.   \n",

We know that there are 290 liters of oil in total and that there are 24 cans.\\n2. We also know that 10 of these cans hold 8 liters each, so those 10 cans hold a total of 10 * 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 liters of oil.\\n3. Now we need to find out how much oil the remaining cans hold. First, let's calculate how many cans are left: 24 (total cans) - 10 (cans with 8 liters each) = <<24-10=14>>14 cans.\\n4. We don't have any information about the volume of those remaining cans, but we do know that the total volume of oil in all the cans is 290 liters. So, the oil in the remaining 14 cans must hold: 290 (total liters) - 80 (liters in 10 cans) = <<290-80=210>>210 liters of oil.\\n5. Since we don't know the individual volumes of those remaining cans, we cannot determine the volume of each can directly from this information. We would need to either find more information or make some assumptions based on context or previous knowledge.\\n\\nSo, without further information, it is impossible to determine how much oil each of the remaining cans is holding.   \n",

So, the amount he earned from just mowing lawns is:\\n$33 * 16 = $528\\n\\nThen, we have information that three of his customers gave him a tip of $10 each. So, the total amount of tips Lee received is:\\n$10 * 3 = $30\\n\\nNow, to find the total amount of money Lee earned last week from mowing lawns and receiving tips, we simply add the two amounts together:\\n$528 + $30 = $558\\n\\nTherefore, Lee earned a total of $558 mowing lawns and receiving tips last week.   \n",

Total distance in 1st 3 days = 0.67 * 3 = 2 miles.\\n- Day 4: ran 10 miles.\\nTotal distance for Jesse = 2 miles + 10 miles = 12 miles.\\n\\nDays for Jesse = 1 week / 7 days = 7 days, so she runs at an average of 12 miles / 7 days = approximately 1.71 miles per day over the entire week.\\n\\nMia's daily distances:\\n- First 4 days: averages 3 miles a day, so total distance in first 4 days is 3 * 4 = 12 miles.\\n\\nTotal distance for Mia = Jesse's total distance = 12 miles.\\n\\nSince they both covered the same total distance (12 miles), they have to cover the same average distance per day over the final three days to finish the race together.\\n- Average daily distance needed = Total distance / Total number of days\\n- Total number of days for both = 7 (first 4 days) + 3 (final days) = 10 days\\n\\nAverage daily distance needed = 12 miles / 10 days ≈ 1.2 miles per day for the final three days.   \n",

We know that the ratio of their coins is 10:45, which can also be expressed as x:y = 10:45 or 2:9. Since we know that their total number of coins is 440, we have x + y = 440.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many coins Amalie has using the given ratio:\\nx : y = 2 : 9\\nx = 2 * (number of coins Amalie has)\\ny = 9 * (number of coins Amalie has)\\n\\nWe know that x + y = 440, so we can set up the following equation:\\n2z + 9z = 440, where z is the number of coins Amalie has.\\n\\nSolving this equation for z, we get:\\n11z = 440\\nz = 40\\n\\nSo, Amalie originally had 40 coins. Now, let's find out how many coins she spends on toys:\\nShe spends 3/4 of what she has on toys:\\nCoins spent on toys = (3/4) * 40\\n= 30\\n\\nTherefore, Amalie remains with:\\nNumber of coins left = Original number of coins - Coins spent on toys\\n= 40 - 30\\n= 10\\n\\nSo, Amalie will remain with 10 coins after spending 3/4 of them on toys.   \n",

Adding the number of arms on the seastar (14), we get:\\n\\nTotal number of arms = 35 + 14\\n= 49\\n\\nTherefore, the animals Carly collected have a total of 49 arms.   \n",

Hillary sells 3 crafts for $12 each. So, she makes a total of $12 x 3 = $36 from selling the crafts.\\n2. She receives an extra $7 from the appreciative customer.\\n3. In total, she earns $36 (from craft sales) + $7 (extra money) = $43.\\n4. Later, she deposits $18 into her bank account.\\n5. After making the deposit, she has $43 (total earnings) - $18 (deposited amount) = $25 left in hand.\\n\\nTherefore, Hillary is left with $25 after making the deposit.   \n",

The volume of a rectangular prism (like an aquarium) can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\nVolume = Length * Width * Height\\n\\nThe aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high. So the original volume was:\\n\\nOriginal Volume = 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = 6 square feet * 3 ft = 18 cubic feet (6 ft * 6 ft = 36 square feet)\\n\\nSince half of the water spilled, there were originally 9 cubic feet in the aquarium. After Nancy triples the amount of water, there are now:\\n\\nCurrent Volume = Original Volume + Spilled Water\\n                      = 18 cubic feet + 9 cubic feet\\n                      = 27 cubic feet\\n\\nSo the volume of water in the aquarium is now 27 cubic feet.   \n",

We know that the total weight loss was 103 kg.\\n2. The first person lost 27 kg.\\n3. The second person lost 7 kg less than the first person, so they lost 27 kg - 7 kg = 20 kg.\\n4. The remaining two people lost the same amount of weight.\\n5. Let x be the weight that each of the last two people lost. Then their total weight loss is 2x.\\n6. We know that their total weight loss, along with those of the first three people, equals 103 kg. So, 27 kg + 20 kg + 2x = 103 kg.\\n7. Solving for x, we get: 2x = 56 kg (subtracting the weights of the first two people). So, x = 28 kg.\\n\\nTherefore, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.   \n",

So, we can set up another equation:\\n\\nPeppers = 2 * Cucumbers\\n\\nNow, we can use substitution to solve for both variables:\\n\\nPeppers = 2 * Cucumbers\\nPeppers = (2 * (Cucumbers + 60))\\n\\nTo find the value of Cucumbers, we'll first extract and solve for it in the second equation:\\n\\nPeppers = 2 * (Cucumbers + 60)\\nPeppers = 2 * Cucumbers * 1 + 2 * 60\\nPeppers = 2 * Cucumbers + 120\\n\\nSince Peppers = 2 * Cucumbers, we have:\\n\\n2 * Cucumbers + 120 = 2 * Cucumbers\\n\\nNow, we need to solve for the difference between both sides of the equation:\\n\\n120 = 0 * Cucumbers\\n120 = 0\\n\\nThis equation is not solvable because the right side is equal to zero, while the left side has a non-zero value. Therefore, we have an inconsistent system of equations and cannot determine a unique solution for the number of vegetables produced in the garden.\\n\\nIt looks like there might be missing information or an error in the problem statement.   \n",

He loses 3 kg every month, so in total, he will lose 3 kg * number of months between his current weight and the day of the fight.\\n\\nThe fight is still 4 months away from the current date, so the boxer will weigh:\\n\\n97 kg - (3 kg/month * 4 months) = 97 kg - 12 kg = 85 kg\\n\\nTherefore, the boxer will weigh 85 kg on the day of the fight.   \n",

Since there are 25 people in total (Manny plus 24 classmates and one teacher), and each gets one piece, we have:\\n\\nTotal pieces = Number of people * Pieces per person\\n                   = 25 * 1\\n                   = 25\\n\\nNow, since there are three pies, and each pie is cut into ten slices:\\n\\nTotal slices = Number of pies * Slices per pie\\n                    = 3 * 10\\n                    = 30\\n\\nSince all the pieces have been distributed to the 25 people, there should be no slices left. However, we can calculate how many slices are left if some were not eaten:\\n\\nSlices left = Total slices - Total pieces consumed\\n                   = 30 - 25\\n                   = 5\\n\\nSo, theoretically, there could be five slices left if some people didn't eat theirs. But since we know that all the pieces were distributed, there should be no slices left.   \n",

So we can set up a proportion:\\n\\nCans Jennifer bought : Cans Mark bought = 6 : 5\\n\\nLet x be the number of sets of 5 and 6 cans that Jennifer and Mark purchased respectively:\\n\\n6x = 5x + 40 (Jennifer bought 40 cans before meeting Mark)\\n\\nSolving for x, we get:\\n\\nx = 8\\n\\nSo Mark bought 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 cans.\\n\\nSince Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every set of 5 cans Mark bought, she bought an additional:\\n\\nCans Jennifer bought in addition to her initial purchase = 8 sets * 6\\n                                                                              = <<8*6=48>>48 cans\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of cans Jennifer brought home from the store is:\\n\\nTotal cans Jennifer bought = Cans she purchased initially + Additional cans\\n                                         = 40 + 48\\n                                         = <<40+48=88>>88 cans.   \n",

In the first round, Sam skipped 1 more time than Jeff, so Jeff skipped 15 times (Sam skipped 16).\\n2. In the second round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam, so Jeff skipped 13 times (Sam skipped 16).\\n3. In the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam, so Jeff skipped 17 times (Sam skipped 13).\\n4. In the fourth round, Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam did, so Jeff skipped 8 times (Sam skipped 16).\\n\\nNow we can find the average number of skips per round for Jeff:\\n\\nThe total number of skips Jeff completed in all rounds is 15 + 13 + 17 + 8 = 53 skips.\\nSince there were 4 rounds, we divide the total number of skips by the number of rounds to find the average:\\nAverage number of skips per round = Total skips / Number of rounds = 53 / 4 = 13.25 skips.\\nHowever, since it is not possible for someone to complete a fraction of a skip during a competition, we need to round up or down to the nearest whole number.\\n\\nIn this case, Jeff's average number of skips per round is approximately 13.

They would need an additional hat or two to evenly distribute the hats between them.\\n\\nSo, they each get approximately 58 hats when considering rounding up for the red hats for Zola.   \n",

This is because there are 10 floors in the hotel, and on each floor there are 10 identical rooms available for guests, except for the last floor which has no rooms. Therefore, a total of 9 floors with 10 rooms each offer a possibility for Hans to be checked in. Consequently, the total number of different rooms where Hans could potentially be accommodated is calculated as the product of the number of floors (9) and the number of rooms per floor (10), which results in 9 x 10 = 90 different rooms.   \n",

Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese (let's assume Therese's birth month is January). So, Jolyn is born in March (January + 2 months).\\n2. Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. Let's assume Aivo was born in June (for simplicity, we could have assumed any other month, the calculation would be the same). So, Therese is born in November (June + 5 months).\\n3. Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. So, Leon is born in August (June + 2 months).\\n4. To find out how old Jolyn is compared to Leon, we need to calculate the number of months between their birth months:\\n   - Jolyn was born in March\\n   - Leon was born in August\\n   - To find the difference in months, we can subtract the earlier month from the later month and add 12 if necessary (since there are 12 months in a year): 8 (August) - 3 (March) = 5, then add 12: 5 + 12 = 17\\n\\nSo, Jolyn is 17 months older than Leon.   \n",

First, let's determine how many ounces Peter bought using the amount of money he brought to the store:\\n   ounces_bought = money_brought / cost_per_ounce\\n   = $2 / $0.25\\n   = 8 ounces\\n\\n2. However, we know that Peter left with only $0.50 in change. So, the actual number of ounces he bought must have been less than what he initially calculated:\\n\\n3. We need to find the difference between the amount of money Peter brought and the change he received:\\n   difference = money_brought - change\\n   = $2 - $0.50\\n   = $1.50\\n\\n4. Now we can determine how many additional ounces Peter bought with this difference:\\n   ounces_extra = difference / cost_per_ounce\\n   = $1.50 / $0.25\\n   = 6 ounces\\n\\n5. Therefore, the total number of ounces Peter bought is the sum of the initial amount and the extra he got with the change:\\n   ounces_total = ounces_bought + ounces_extra\\n   = 8 + 6\\n   = 14 ounces\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that Peter initially calculated that he could buy only 8 ounces, and the actual amount he bought (14 ounces) exceeded his initial expectation. This discrepancy might have occurred due to rounding errors or other factors such as taxes or discounts that were not accounted for in our calculation.\\n\\nTherefore, Peter ended up buying approximately 14 ounces of soda.   \n",

We know that its initial weight was 400 pounds and it gained weight to be 1.5 times its initial weight:\\n\\nNew weight = Initial weight * 1.5\\nNew weight = 400 pounds * 1.5\\nNew weight = 600 pounds\\n\\nNow, let's calculate how much more the cow is worth after gaining the weight by finding the difference between its new weight and initial weight, then multiplying that by the price per pound:\\n\\nPrice difference = New weight - Initial weight\\nPrice difference = 600 pounds - 400 pounds\\nPrice difference = 200 pounds * $3/pound\\nPrice difference = $600\\n\\nSo, John can sell the cow for an additional $600 after it gained the weight.   \n",

Since his regular workday is 8 hours long, and he puts in an additional 2 hours to earn the bonus, his total workday is 10 hours long.\\n\\nNow, let's calculate John's total daily earnings:\\n\\nDaily wage without bonus = $80\\nBonus = $20 per day\\nTotal daily earnings with bonus = Daily wage + Bonus = $80 + $20 = $100\\n\\nNext, we need to determine John's hourly wage with the bonus. We know that he works 10 hours to earn this wage:\\n\\nHourly wage with bonus = Total daily earnings with bonus / Total hours worked per day\\n= $100 / 10 hours\\n= $10 per hour\\n\\nSo, if John decides to work hard and earn the performance bonus, he makes $10 per hour.   \n",

Alice had 20 quarters before she went to the bank.\\n2. Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, Alice had $20 in total before the exchange (20 quarters * $0.25/quarter).\\n3. She exchanged all her quarters for nickels. The number of nickels she received is found by dividing the total value of the quarters by the value of each nickel: $20 / $0.05 = 400 nickels (since a nickel is worth $0.05).\\n\\nNow, we know that 20% of these nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. Let's calculate the number and total value of these:\\n\\n1. 20% of 400 nickels = 80 iron nickels (400 nickels * 0.2)\\n2. Each iron nickel is worth $3, so the total value of all iron nickels is 80 * $3 = $240\\n\\nSince Alice still has the remaining 80% of her nickels ($20), let's calculate their total value:\\n\\n1. The value of 320 regular nickels (400 - 80) is 320 * $0.05 = $16.\\n2. So, the total value of all nickels (iron + regular) is $240 (from iron nickels) + $16 (from regular nickels) = $256.\\n\\nTherefore, the total value of Alice's money now is $256.   \n",

Then we can set up equations based on the information given:\\n\\n1) x - 4 = number of gumballs given to Todd\\n2) 2(x - 4) = number of gumballs given to Alisha\\n3) 4 * (number of gumballs given to Alisha) - 5 = number of gumballs given to Bobby\\n4) x - 6 = number of gumballs left\\n\\nWe need to find the value of x, which represents the initial number of gumballs Hector had.\\n\\nFirst, let's solve equations 1, 2, and 4 for the unknowns:\\n\\n1) x = Todd + 4\\n2) x - 4 = 2A (where A is the number of gumballs given to Alisha)\\n4) x = B + 6 (where B is the number of gumballs given to Bobby)\\n\\nNow, we can use equation 3 and substitute x with Todd + 4:\\n\\n3) 4A - 5 = B\\n\\nSince we don't have any direct information about the relationship between A and B, it's impossible to find a unique solution for x. However, we can determine that x is some positive integer value. If Hector had given out all his gumballs without keeping any for himself, he wouldn't have had 6 left. Thus, there must be an even number of gumballs in the container to begin with, so that he could divide it into sets of equal size (with one extra set for Bobby).\\n\\nA possible solution is x = 14, which results in Todd having 10 gumballs, Alisha having 12 gumballs, and Bobby having 9 gumballs. This leaves Hector with the remaining 6 gumballs. However, there could be other solutions as well, depending on the specific values of the number of gumballs given to each person.\\n\\nIn summary, while we cannot find a unique solution for the total number of gumballs Hector purchased, we do know that it must be an even number.   \n",
       "99   To find out how many more fish Gail has in the first tank compared to the second tank, we need to calculate the number of inches and gallons of water for each tank based on the given information, and then determine the number of fish that can be kept in each tank.\\n\\nFirst, let's find the size of the second tank: Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank, we can represent the volume of the second tank as half the volume of the first tank.\\n\\nGallons in the first tank = 48 gallons\\nThe first tank is twice the size of the second tank => Gallons in the second tank = Gallons in the first tank / 2\\n                                         => Gallons in the second tank = 48 gallons / 2\\n                                         => Gallons in the second tank = 24 gallons\\n\\nNext, let's calculate the number of inches for each tank based on the given rule:\\n\\nGallons per inch (for fish) = 1 gallon\\nInches in the first tank = Gallons in the first tank / Gallons per inch\\n                                     = 48 gallons / 1 gallon/inch\\n                                     ≈ 48 inches\\n\\nSince the second tank is half the size of the first tank:\\nInches in the second tank = Inches in the first tank / 2\\n                                       = 48 inches / 2\\n                                       = 24 inches\\n\\nNow, let's find out how many fish Gail can keep in each tank based on their sizes:\\n\\nTwo-inch fish per gallon = 1 gallon / 2 inches = 0.5 fish/gallon\\nThree-inch fish per gallon = 1 gallon / 3 inches = 0.33 fish/gallon (rounded)\\n\\nFish in the second tank = Gallons in the second tank * Fish per gallon for two-inch fish\\n                                   = 24 gallons * 0.5 fish/gallon\\n                                   = 12 fish\\n\\nFish in the first tank = Gallons in the first tank * Fish per gallon for three-inch fish\\n                                 = 48 gallons * 0.33 fish/gallon\\n                                 = 15.32 ≈ 16 fish (assuming no fractional fish)\\n\\nFinally, to find out how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank, we can subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank:\\n\\nMore fish = Fish in the first tank - Fish in the second tank\\n                 = 16 fish - 12 fish\\n                 = 4 fish.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the calculation assumes that no fish in the first tank have been eaten by others. If one fish eats another in the first tank, the number of fish would decrease accordingly.   \n",

Betty needs a total of $100 for the new wallet.\\n2. She currently has $50 from her own savings and an additional $15 from her parents, making it a total of $65.\\n3. Her grandparents have promised to give her twice as much as her parents did, which is $15 * 2 = $30.\\n4. Therefore, Betty has a total of $65 + $30 = $95.\\n\\nHowever, she still needs $100 for the wallet. The difference between what she has and what she needs is: $100 - $95 = $5.\\n\\nSo Betty only needs an additional $5 to buy the wallet.   \n",

We know that there are 10 yellow flowers, and there are 80% more of those in purple, so there are 10 * 1.8 = <<10*1.8=18>>18 purple flowers.\\n\\nWe also know that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. So, the number of green flowers is (1/4) * (10 + 18) = 6.25 * 28 = <<6.25*28=176.4>>176.4, but since we cannot have a fraction of a flower, Mark must have at least 177 green flowers in his garden.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of flowers Mark has is 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) + 177 (green) = <<10+18+177=195>>195.   \n",

Since each new ship has twice as many people as the previous one, we can represent the number of people on the ships from the second to the third hundreds-years interval as 2x and 2 * 2x = 4x.\\n\\nThe total number of people consumed by the monster over three hundred years is given as 847. So, we have:\\n\\nx + 1 * (2x) + 1 * (4x) = 847\\nx + 2x + 2x = 847\\n5x = 847\\nx = 169.4\\n\\nHowever, since there cannot be a fraction of a person, this problem likely contains an error or inconsistency.

We know that Tobias spent $95 on the shoes and had $15 left, so he spent a total of $110:\\nTotal money earned = Money spent on shoes + Change\\n= $95 + $15\\n= $110\\n\\nSince we already know how much money Tobias made from mowing lawns, we can find out how much money he made from shoveling driveways by subtracting the amount he earned from mowing from the total amount of money he earned:\\nMoney earned from shoveling = Total money earned - Money earned from mowing\\n= $110 - $60\\n= $50\\n\\nNow, we can find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled by dividing the amount of money he made from shoveling by the amount of money he charges per driveway:\\nNumber of driveways shoveled = Money earned from shoveling / Money per driveway\\n= $50 / $7\\n≈ 7.14\\n\\nSince Tobias can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we know that he must have shoveled 7 driveways to earn exactly $50. Therefore, Tobias mowed 4 lawns and shoveled 7 driveways.   \n",

We know that Randy has 60 mango trees.\\n2. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\\n3. Half the number of mango trees is 60 / 2 = 30.\\n4. Therefore, Randy has 5 less than 30, so he has 25 coconut trees.\\n5. Now we add the number of mango and coconut trees: 60 (mango trees) + 25 (coconut trees) = 85 trees in all.\\n\\nSo, Randy has 85 trees on his farm.   \n",

John also took away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. So, John took away 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats. Therefore, there are now 15 - 12 = 3 green hard hats left.\\n4. Initially, there were 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats in the truck.

We know that the distance to and from work is 20 miles each way, so the total distance covered during his daily commute is 40 miles. Since Tim can bike at a speed of 25 mph, we can calculate the time it takes for one-way commuting:\\n\\nTime = Distance / Speed\\nTime_one_way = 20 miles / 25 mph = 0.8 hours or 48 minutes\\n\\nSince Tim rides his bike to and from work each day, the total time he spends biking each workday is:\\n\\nTotal Time for daily commute = Time_one_way * 2 = 0.8 hours * 2 = 1.6 hours or 96 minutes\\n\\nNow that we know Tim spends 1.6 hours commuting daily, we can calculate how much time he spends biking per week:\\n\\nWeekly bike time = Daily bike time * Days in a week\\nWeekly bike time = 1.6 hours * 5 days * 7 days/week = 48 hours\\n\\nTherefore, Tim spends approximately 48 hours biking each week.   \n",

Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, so a jaguar consumes 30 birds per day (5 snakes * 6 birds/snake).\\n4. There are 6 jaguars in the forest, so they consume a total of 180 birds per day between them (30 birds/jaguar * 6 jaguars).\\n5. Since each bird eats 12 beetles per day, to find out how many beetles are consumed daily by all the birds in the forest, we multiply the number of birds eaten by the jaguars by the number of beetles each bird consumes: 180 birds * 12 beetles/bird = 2160 beetles per day.\\n\\nTherefore, there are 2160 beetles eaten in the forest each day.   \n",

We know that there are three fewer letters in Samantha's last name than in Bobbie's last name.\\n2. When Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she had a last name with twice the length of Jamie's last name (which has 5 letters).\\n3. So, the difference between the number of letters in Samantha's last name and Bobbie's last name is: 5 (Jamie's last name) x 2 (twice the length for Bobbie) - 5 (Jamie's last name) = 8\\n4. Since there are three fewer letters in Samantha's last name, we subtract 3 from the number of letters in Bobbie's last name: 8 - 3 = 5\\n5. Therefore, Samantha's last name has 5 letters.\\n\\nThe answer is that Samantha's last name has 5 letters.   \n",

He then downloaded an additional 400 files but realized that 3/5 (or 60%) of those were also irrelevant. To find out how many valuable files are left after the second round of deletions, we can multiply the number of relevant files from the first round by the percentage that were kept in the second round and add it to the number of relevant files from the second round:\\n\\nNumber of valuable files = (Number of relevant files from the first round) * (Percentage kept from the second round) + (Number of relevant files from the second round)\\n\\nNumber of valuable files = 300 * (1 - 60%) + 400 * 60%\\n\\nFirst, calculate the number of relevant files that were kept in the second round:\\n\\nRelevant files from the second round = (Total downloaded files in the second round) * (Percentage kept)\\n\\nRelevant files from the second round = 400 * 60%\\n\\nNow, calculate the number of valuable files:\\n\\nNumber of valuable files = (300) * (1 - 0.6) + (400 * 0.6)\\n\\nNumber of valuable files = 300 * 0.4 + 240\\n\\nNumber of valuable files = 120 + 240\\n\\nNumber of valuable files = 360\\n\\nSo, Brennan was left with 360 valuable files after deleting the unrelated files in the second round.   \n",

We know that 40% of Mr. Sanchez's students did not meet this standard:\\n\\nNumber of students with final grade below B = Percentage * Total number of students\\n= 0.4 * 60\\n= 24 students\\n\\nNow, to find the number of students who received a final grade of B or above, we can subtract the number of students below a B from the total number of students:\\n\\nNumber of students with final grade B and above = Total number of students - Number of students with final grade below B\\n= 60 - 24\\n= 36 students\\n\\nSo, Mr. Sanchez has 36 Grade 5 students who earned a final grade of B or better.   \n",

Lisa earned half of the total earnings, which is $60 * 0.5 = $30.\\n2. Jack and Tommy shared the remaining half of the earnings, so each earned an equal share of $30.\\n3. Therefore, Tommy earned $30 / 2 = $15.\\n4. To find the difference in earnings between Lisa and Tommy, subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's: $30 - $15 = $15.\\n\\nSo, Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.   \n",

The difference is:\\n\\nTickets bought above 10 = Total tickets bought - 10\\n= 12 - 10\\n= 2 tickets\\n\\nNext, we need to find out how much the discount is for these 2 tickets. We know that the discount is 5% of the price of each ticket:\\n\\nDiscount per ticket = Ticket cost * Discount rate\\n= $40 * 0.05\\n= $2\\n\\nSince Mr. Benson bought 2 tickets with this discount, we can calculate the total discount as:\\n\\nTotal discount = Discount per ticket * Number of discounted tickets\\n= $2 * 2\\n= $4\\n\\nNow that we have the total discount, we need to find out how much Mr. Benson paid for the non-discounted tickets. We know that each non-discounted ticket costs $40:\\n\\nCost of non-discounted tickets = Ticket cost * Number of non-discounted tickets\\n= $40 * 10\\n= $400\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid by subtracting the discount from the cost of the non-discounted tickets:\\n\\nTotal payment = Cost of non-discounted tickets - Total discount\\n= $400 - $4\\n= $396\\n\\nTherefore, Mr. Benson paid a total of $396 for the concert tickets.   \n",

First, let's find out how many bananas are in each pile for the first group of 6 piles, where each hand has 14 bananas and there are 9 hands in a pile.\\n   Bananas per pile = Hands per pile * Bananas per hand\\n   Bananas per pile = 9 hands * 14 bananas/hand = 126 bananas\\n2. Next, we need to find out how many bananas are in the remaining piles where there are 12 hands and each hand has 9 bananas.\\n   Bananas per pile = Hands per pile * Bananas per hand\\n   Bananas per pile = 12 hands * 9 bananas/hand = 108 bananas\\n3. The total number of bananas collected is the sum of bananas in both types of piles.\\n   Total bananas = Bananas in first type of pile + Bananas in second type of pile\\n   Total bananas = 126 * 6 (piles) + 108 * 2 (remaining piles) = 756 + 216 = 972 bananas\\n4. Since there are 12 monkeys in the family, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey would get if they divide the total bananas equally amongst themselves.\\n   Bananas per monkey = Total bananas / Number of monkeys\\n   Bananas per monkey = 972 bananas / 12 monkeys = 81 bananas/monkey\\n\\nTherefore, each monkey would get 81 bananas if they divide the bananas equally amongst themselves.   \n",

We also know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did, so Alan collected:\\n   Alan's shells = 4 * Ben's shells\\n   = 4 * 12\\n   = 48 shells\\n\\nSo the answer is that Alan collected 48 shells.   \n",

We'll assume that Gerald wants to have this amount saved up before the next baseball season begins.\\n\\nNow let's find out how many hours he needs to work each chore to save up $400 during the off-season. Since he charges $10 for each chore, we'll need to figure out how many hours of work are equivalent to $400.\\n\\nFirst, let's divide the total amount he wants to save by the price he charges per chore:\\n$400 ÷ $10/chore = <<400/10=40>>40 hours\\n\\nSo Gerald needs to work for 40 hours to earn enough money to cover his baseball supplies for the next season.\\n\\nTo find out how many hours he can work during the off-season in a month, let's assume that he works full-time during the weekends and has about 15 hours available per weekend. So, he has approximately 30 hours (2 weekends x 15 hours) available to work each month.\\n\\nTo find out how many chores he needs to do on average per month to save up for his supplies, we'll divide the total number of hours he needs by the number of hours he can work in a month:\\n40 hours (total hours needed) ÷ 30 hours (hours available per month) = <<40/30=1.33333333333>>1.33 chores/month\\n\\nSince Gerald cannot do a fraction of a chore, he will need to do this calculation every month and save up slightly more than needed during some months to ensure that he has enough saved up for the next baseball season. Therefore, Gerald should aim for an average of 2 chores per month (rounded up) to have sufficient savings for his baseball supplies.   \n",

The remaining pencils were shared equally among his five friends.\\n4. Each friend received eight pencils.\\n5. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we first need to determine how many pencils were left after Arnel took ten for himself.\\n6. Since there were ten boxes, and each box initially had the same number of pencils as the one Arnel kept, we can represent the total number of pencils in all boxes as 10 * X (where X is the number of pencils in each box).\\n7. After taking ten pencils for himself, Arnel left the remaining ones to be shared among his five friends. So, there were 10 * X - 10 pencils left.\\n8. Each friend received eight pencils, so we need to find how many boxes with X pencils in each could produce that many pencils for all of them: 5 * 8 = 40.\\n9. Comparing the total number of remaining pencils (10 * X - 10) and the number of pencils that went to Arnel's friends, we have 10 * X - 10 = 40 * 5.\\n10. Solving this equation, we get: 10X = 200.\\n11. Dividing both sides by 10, we find X = 20.\\n\\nTherefore, there are 20 pencils in each box.   \n",

In total, Leo spent 25 + 50 = 75 minutes on the first and second parts of the assignment.\\n4. He mentioned that he was able to finish his entire assignment in 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\\n5.

Chocolate chip cookies: 10 kg * 0.5 = 5 kg\\n2. Peanut butter cookies: 10 kg * 0.2 = 2 kg\\n3. Sugar cookies: Let's assume the remaining butter was 7 kg (since 10 kg - 5 kg - 2 kg = 3 kg is used for chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies). Then, 7 kg * (1/3) = 2.33 kg\\n\\nNow let's calculate the total amount of butter used: 5 kg + 2 kg + 2.33 kg = 9.33 kg\\n\\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a kilogram, we can assume that Liza bought an extra 0.67 kg of butter to cover the fractional amounts. The total amount of butter used is then 10 kg + 0.67 kg = 10.67 kg.\\n\\nHowever, since the initial weight was given as a multiple of kilograms, it is unlikely that Liza would have bought an extra 0.67 kg of butter. Therefore, we can assume that she might have some leftover butter, but the exact amount cannot be determined with the provided information.\\n\\nSo, after making chocolate chip, peanut butter, and sugar cookies, there is likely some butter left over, but the exact amount isn't known based on the given information.   \n",

Now we know that there are 40 students who receive an allowance of $6 per day, so we can find out the total amount of money they get in a day by multiplying the number of students by their daily allowance.\\n\\nTotal money for $6 allowance group = Number of students * Daily allowance\\n= 40 students * $6\\n= $240\\n\\n3. The remaining students receive an allowance of $4 per day. We can find out how many students fall into this category by subtracting the number of students in the first group from the total number of students.\\n\\nNumber of students receiving $4 = Total students - Number of students receiving $6\\n= 60 students - 40 students\\n= 20 students\\n\\n4. Now we know that there are 20 students who receive an allowance of $4 per day, so we can find out the total amount of money they get in a day by multiplying the number of students by their daily allowance.\\n\\nTotal money for $4 allowance group = Number of students * Daily allowance\\n= 20 students * $4\\n= $80\\n\\n5. Finally, to find the total amount of money all 60 students get in a day, we add the amounts from both groups.\\n\\nTotal daily allowance for all students = Total money for $6 group + Total money for $4 group\\n= $240 + $80\\n= $320   \n",

Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. Since each daughter has 8 games, her team practices for a total of 8 games * 4 hours/game = <<8*4=32>>32 hours per season.\\n4. To find the total number of hours Jerry spends at the field for one daughter, add the hours she plays and the hours her team practices: 16 hours (games) + 32 hours (practices) = <<16+32=48>>48 hours.\\n5.

The bear gained a fifth of this weight from berries during summer, so it gained 1/5 * W. Autumn was more productive; the bear gained twice that amount from acorns, which is 2 * (1/5) * W = 2/5 * W. We know that the bear gained a total of 3/5 * W during autumn and summer combined, so we can set up an equation:\\n\\n1/5 * W + 2/5 * W = 3/5 * W\\n\\nTo solve for W, first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\\n\\n3/5 * W = 1/5 * W + 2/5 * W\\n\\nSubtract 1/5 * W from both sides:\\n\\n2/5 * W = 2/5 * W + (1/5 * W)\\n\\nNow, subtract 2/5 * W from both sides to isolate the term representing the weight gained from small animals:\\n\\n0 = 1/5 * W\\n\\nThe bear gained 1/5 * W pounds from small animals. Since we don't have a concrete value for W (the total weight the bear needed to gain), we can't calculate the exact number of pounds gained from eating small animals. However, we do know that it was 1/5 of the total weight gained.   \n",

She managed to do 12 sit-ups on Monday and 19 sit-ups on Tuesday, which makes a total of:\\n\\n12 sit-ups (Monday) + 19 sit-ups (Tuesday) = 31 sit-ups\\n\\nHowever, she wanted to do a minimum of 30 sit-ups in total. Since she has already done 31 sit-ups, she has surpassed her goal for this week. Therefore, she doesn't need to do any additional sit-ups on Wednesday. Instead, she can focus on improving her performance and aiming for more than 30 sit-ups in the future.   \n",

Next, we need to add the tips that his customers gave him. Each customer gave him a $10 tip three times, so Lee earned an additional $10 x 3 x 16 = $192 from the tips.\\n3. To find out how much Lee earned in total last week, we simply add the amount he made from mowing lawns to the amount he made from the tips: $528 + $192 = $720.\\n\\nSo, Lee earned a total of $720 from mowing lawns and receiving tips last week.   \n",

Since they have to cover a total of 30 miles, they need to cover an additional 1 mile over the final three days. Thus, their average daily distance for the final three days is 1/3 mile per day (approximately).\\n\\nSo, the average number of miles they need to run per day over the final three days is 1/3 mile. This is a very low number and seems incorrect as it's unlikely they can cover an entire mile less in the last leg of the race than the initial average. It might be worth double-checking the given information for any errors.   \n",

Let's denote Elsa's coins as x and Amalie's coins as y.\\n\\nAccording to the problem statement, the ratio of Elsa's coins to Amalie's coins is 10:45, which can also be represented as a fraction: 10/55 or 2/11. This means that for every 11 coins that Amalie has, Elsa has 2 times that amount.\\n\\nThe total number of coins they both have is given as 440. Let's denote the common part of their coins as c:\\n\\nx + y = 440\\n\\nSince we know that Elsa's portion (x) is 10/55 or 2/11 the size of Amalie's portion (y), we can write an equation for x in terms of y:\\n\\nx = (2/11) * y\\n\\nNow we have two equations with two variables. Let's solve for one variable to find the value of the other:\\n\\ny + x = 440\\ny + (2/11) * y = 440\\n(13/11) * y = 440\\ny = 440 * (11/13)\\ny ≈ 326.92\\n\\nSince the number of coins must be an integer, we will round Amalie's portion to the nearest whole number: y = 327\\n\\nNow we can find Elsa's portion: x = (2/11) * 327 ≈ 186.45\\nWe rounded Amalie's portion up, so Elsa's portion will be smaller than 186. Also, keep in mind that these values are approximate due to the rounding.\\n\\nThe problem statement also mentions that Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys. Let's calculate how many coins Amalie spends on toys:\\n\\nCoins spent on toys = (3/4) * 327\\nCoins spent on toys = 231.25\\n\\nSince the number of coins must be an integer, we will round up to the nearest whole number: 232\\n\\nFinally, we need to find out how many coins Amalie will remain with after spending on toys:\\n\\nTotal coins - Coins spent on toys = Remaining coins\\n327 - 232 = 95\\n\\nTherefore, Amalie will remain with approximately 95 coins.   \n",

So, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of starfish by the number of arms per starfish:\\n\\nTotal arms on starfish = Number of starfish * Arms per starfish\\n= 7 * 5\\n= 35\\n\\nThe seastar has 14 arms, so to find the total number of arms Carly collected, we add the number of arms on the starfish to the number of arms on the seastar:\\n\\nTotal arms = Total arms on starfish + Arms on seastar\\n= 35 + 14\\n= 49\\n\\nTherefore, Carly collected a total of 49 arms on the starfish and the seastar.   \n",

Harry has half as many apples as Tim.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many apples Tim has:\\nTim = Martha + 30\\nTim = 68 + 30\\nTim = 98\\n\\nNow that we know Tim has 98 apples, we can find out how many apples Harry has:\\nHarry = (1/2) * Tim\\nHarry = (1/2) * 98\\nHarry = 49.5\\n\\nSince Harry cannot have half an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number:\\n\\nSo, Harry has 49 apples.   \n",

Then, we have the following information:\\n\\n1. The total weight loss is 103 kg.\\n2. The first person lost 27 kg.\\n3. The second person lost 27 kg - 7 kg = 20 kg.\\n4. The last two people both lost x kg.\\n\\nNow, let's find the weight loss of the last two people:\\n\\n5. The sum of the weight losses of all four people is 103 kg. So, 27 kg + 20 kg + x + x = 103 kg.\\n6. Simplifying this equation, we get 2 * (27 kg + x) + 2 * x = 103 kg.\\n7. Expanding the equation, we have 2 * (54 kg + x) = 103 kg - 2 * x.\\n8. Distributing the 2 on both sides, we get 108 kg + 2x = 103 kg - 2x.\\n9. Solving for x by adding 2x and subtracting 108 kg from both sides, we get 4x = -5 kg. Since weight can't be negative, this equation doesn't have a solution in this scenario. However, if you assume that the four people shared their weight loss equally, each would lose (103 kg / 4) ≈ 26 kg, making the question impossible as stated.\\n\\nAssuming a mistake in the given information or an error in interpreting it, we cannot determine the weight loss of each of the last two people based on this information alone.   \n",

Then, according to the problem, the garden produced 237 potatoes, 60 fewer cucumbers, and twice as many peppers as cucumbers:\\n\\n1) We know that there are 60 fewer cucumbers than peppers, so the number of peppers is x + 60.\\n\\n2) We also know that there are twice as many peppers as cucumbers, so the number of peppers is 2x. Since x + 60 = 2x, we can solve for x:\\n\\n   x + 60 = 2x\\n    x = 2x - 60\\n     x = (2x - 60) / 1\\n\\n3) Solving this equation, we find that x = -120.

We know that he is on a diet to lose 3 kg per month and there are 4 months between his current weight and the day of the fight.\\n\\nSo, the boxer will weigh:\\n\\n97 kg (current weight) - (3 kg/month * 4 months)\\n= 97 kg - (12 kg)\\n= 85 kg\\n\\nTherefore, on the day of the fight, the boxer is expected to weigh 85 kg.   \n",

So, we can set up a proportion:\\n\\nJennifer's cans : Mark's cans = 6 : 5\\n\\nLet x be the number of sets of 5 and 6 cans that Jennifer and Mark bought respectively:\\n\\n40 (Jennifer) = 5x (Mark) + 6x (Jennifer)\\n\\nNow, we can solve for x:\\n\\n34x = 5x\\n29x = 0\\nx = 0 (which is not a valid solution)\\n\\nInstead, let's rewrite the equation as:\\n\\n5x + 6x = 40 + 5x\\n11x = 40\\nx = 3.636... ≈ 4\\n\\nSince we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll assume that Jennifer bought an extra can for herself:\\n\\nJennifer bought 5 sets of 5 cans (25 cans) + 1 additional can = 26 cans\\nMark bought 5 sets of 5 cans (25 cans)\\nTotal cans = 26 cans (Jennifer) + 25 cans (Mark) = 51 cans\\n\\nHowever, it was mentioned that Mark bought 50 cans. To reconcile the discrepancy, we'll assume that Mark didn't buy one set of 5 cans or Jennifer bought an extra can. In this case:\\n\\nJennifer bought 5 sets of 5 cans (25 cans) + 1 additional can = 26 cans\\nMark bought 4 sets of 5 cans (20 cans)\\nTotal cans = 26 cans (Jennifer) + 20 cans (Mark) = 46 cans\\n\\nSince Jennifer initially purchased 40 cans, there's a mistake in the problem statement. It should have been 45 or 46 cans for Jennifer instead of 40. Therefore, Jennifer brought home 26 cans of milk from the store before meeting Mark.   \n",

We know that:\\n\\n1. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round, so S = 16 + 1 = 17 skips, and J = 16 skips. Difference is 1 skip.\\n2. In the second round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam, so J = 16 - 3 = 13 skips, and S = 16 skips. Difference is 3 skips.\\n3. In the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam, so J = 16 + 4 = 20 skips, and S = 16 skips. Difference is 4 skips.\\n4. In the last round, Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam, so Jeff completed J = 16 / 2 = 8 skips, and Sam completed S = 16 skips. Difference is 8 skips.\\n\\nNow we have the following data:\\n\\n- Round 1: S = 17, J = 16, Difference = 1 skip\\n- Round 2: S = 16, J = 13, Difference = 3 skips\\n- Round 3: S = 16, J = 20, Difference = 4 skips\\n- Round 4: S = 16, J = 8, Difference = 8 skips\\n\\nTo find the average number of skips Jeff completed per round, we add up the total number of skips Jeff completed in all rounds and divide that by the total number of rounds.\\n\\nTotal Skips for Jeff = 13 + 20+ 8 = 41 skips\\nTotal Rounds = 4\\n\\nAverage Number of Skips per Round for Jeff = Total Skips / Total Rounds = 41 / 4 = 10.25 skips\\n\\nSince it's not possible to complete a fraction of a skip, we cannot consider this answer as accurate. Instead, we should say that the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is approximately 10 skips.   \n",

So,\\n\\nRed hats for Zola = Red hats for Paityn * (4/5)\\n= 20 * (4/5)\\n= 20 * 0.8\\n= 16 red hats\\n\\nNext, let's find out how many blue hats Zola has: We know that Zola has twice the number of blue hats as Paityn. So,\\n\\nBlue hats for Zola = Blue hats for Paityn * 2\\n= 24 * 2\\n= 48 blue hats\\n\\nNow, let's calculate how many total hats they both have when combined:\\nTotal red hats = Red hats for Paityn + Red hats for Zola\\n= 20 + 16\\n= 36\\n\\nTotal blue hats = Blue hats for Paityn + Blue hats for Zola\\n= 24 + 48\\n= 72\\n\\nSo, when they combine all the hats together and share them equally between themselves, each gets:\\n\\nTotal hats per person = (Total red hats + Total blue hats) / 2\\n= (36 + 72) / 2\\n= 108 / 2\\n= 54\\n\\nTherefore, each gets 54 hats when they combine and share them equally.   \n",

First, let's calculate how many ounces Peter was able to buy with the $2 he brought: 2 dollars = 2 x 16 oz (since there are 4 quarters or 1 dollar in 16 cents) = 32 oz.\\n2. Next, we need to determine how many ounces he bought and left with 50 cents: We know that each ounce costs 25 cents, so the number of ounces he bought can be found by dividing the amount of money spent on soda (leaving with 50 cents) by the cost per ounce. So, 50 cents = 50/25 oz = 2 oz.\\n3. The difference between the amount Peter brought and the amount he left is the number of ounces of soda he bought: 32 oz (brought) - 2 oz (left) = 30 oz.\\n\\nTherefore, Peter bought 30 ounces of soda.   \n",

We know that its initial weight was 400 pounds and it gained an amount equal to 1.5 times its starting weight:\\n\\nNew weight = Initial weight + (1.5 * Initial weight)\\nNew weight = 400 lb + (1.5 * 400 lb)\\nNew weight = 400 lb + 600 lb\\nNew weight = 1000 lb\\n\\nNow that we know the cow weighs 1000 pounds, let's calculate how much more it is worth after gaining the weight:\\n\\nAdditional value = New weight * Price per pound\\nAdditional value = 1000 lb * $3/lb\\nAdditional value = $3000\\n\\nSo, John's cow is worth an additional $3000 after it gained the weight.   \n",

According to the problem, he sold twice that many in the second year, so the number of geckos sold in the second year is 2x. The total number of geckos sold in the last two years is the sum of these two numbers:\\n\\nTotal geckos sold = Geckos sold in first year + Geckos sold in second year\\n= x + 2x\\n= 3x\\n\\nTherefore, Brandon has sold a total of 3x geckos in the last two years. However, we don't have a specific value for x, as we only know that he sold twice as many geckos in the second year as in the first. To find the exact number of geckos, we would need more information. For example, if we knew that Brandon sold 43 geckos in the first year, then we could calculate that he sold 86 geckos in the second year (twice as many), and therefore the total number of geckos sold would be 129. But without that information, we cannot determine an exact number.   \n",

So, we need to calculate that number: 40 * 1.4 = 56 books (1.4 = 1 + 0.4)\\n\\nTherefore, Krystian borrows 56 books on Fridays.\\n\\nThe library is open from Monday to Friday, so there are 5 days in a week for Krystian to borrow books. Since he borrows 40 books every day except for Fridays, when he borrows 56 books, we can calculate his weekly borrowing as follows:\\n\\nWeekly borrowing = (Daily borrowing * Number of days) + (Daily borrowing * Percentage increase * Number of Fridays)\\n                         = (40 * 5) + (40 * 1.4 * 1)\\n                         = 200 + 56\\n                         = 256 books\\n\\nSo, Krystian borrows 256 books in a week.   \n",

Since John ordered twice the amount of beef, he ordered 2000 pounds of chicken:\\n2000 pounds * $3/pound = $6000\\n\\nNow, we can add up the costs to find the total cost:\\n$8000 (beef) + $6000 (chicken) = $14,000.\\n\\nSo, John's order for the restaurant cost a total of $14,000.   \n",

To find out how many days it takes him to write 1200 pages, we divide the total number of pages by his daily writing output:\\n\\nNumber of days = Total pages / Pages per day\\nNumber of days = 1200 pages / 20 pages/day\\nNumber of days = 60 days\\n\\nTherefore, it will take John approximately 60 days to write three 400-page books. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes that John writes consistently at a rate of 20 pages per day without any interruptions or breaks. In real life, factors such as illness, distractions, and other commitments might affect the actual writing time.   \n",

Since we don't know how many mystery books there were, we can't include them in the total yet.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimum number of books Nancy had on the cart when she started is the sum of the books she actually shelved: 24 (from the top) + 11 (from the bottom) = <<24+11=35>>35 books.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that this answer might not be the exact number if we don't know how many mystery books were initially on the bottom of the cart.

Then, the number of gumballs he gave to Alisha was 2x, and the number of gumballs he gave to Bobby was 4a - 1, where a is the number of gumballs he gave to Alisha.\\n\\nWe know that Hector had 6 gumballs left, so we can set up an equation:\\n\\nx + 2x + (4a - 1) = Total number of gumballs\\n\\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\\n\\n3x + 4a - 1 = Total number of gumballs\\n\\nSince Hector had some gumballs left, the total number of gumballs he purchased must be greater than what he gave away. Let's consider a few possibilities for x and check if they result in a reasonable total number of gumballs:\\n\\nCase 1: x = 2 (Hector gave 2 gumballs to Todd)\\nIn this case, 3x + 4a - 1 = 2(2) + 4a - 1 = 4 + 4a - 1\\nSolving for a, we get a = 2. So Hector gave 2 gumballs to Todd, 4 * 2 = 8 gumballs to Alisha, and 4 * 2 - 1 = 7 gumballs to Bobby. The total number of gumballs is 13, which is not enough for Hector to have had some left over.\\n\\nCase 2: x = 3 (Hector gave 3 gumballs to Todd)\\nIn this case, 3x + 4a - 1 = 3(3) + 4a - 1 = 9 + 4a - 1\\nSolving for a, we get a = 2. So Hector gave 3 gumballs to Todd, 4 * 2 = 8 gumballs to Alisha, and 4 * 2 - 1 = 7 gumballs to Bobby. The total number of gumballs is 13, which is not enough for Hector to have had some left over.\\n\\nCase 3: x = 4 (Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd)\\nIn this case, 3x + 4a - 1 = 4(3) + 4a - 1 = 12 + 4a - 1\\nSolving for a, we get a = 2. So Hector gave 4 gumballs to Todd, 4 * 2 = 8 gumballs to Alisha, and 4 * 2 - 1 = 7 gumballs to Bobby. The total number of gumballs is 13, which is not enough for Hector to have had some left over.\\n\\nBased on the cases above, it seems that no matter how many gumballs Hector gave to Todd, he cannot have had any left over with the given conditions. This means there must be an error in the problem statement or the conditions cannot produce a valid solution.   \n",
       "99   To find out how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank, we need to calculate the number of inches and gallons of water for each tank based on the given information, and then use that to determine the number of fish for each tank.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate the size of each tank:\\n\\n1. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. Let's represent the size of the second tank as x gallons. Then, the size of the first tank would be 2x gallons.\\n2. We know that there are 48 gallons in the first tank. So, we have the equation: 2x = 48\\n3. Solving for x, we get: x = 16 gallons (the second tank is 16 gallons)\\n4. Therefore, the size of the first tank is 2 * 16 = 32 gallons\\n\\nNext, let's calculate the number of fish in each tank based on the fish size and water volume:\\n\\n1. In the second tank, we have two-inch fish. Using the given rule, one gallon of water is for one inch of fish. So, to find out how many gallons of water are needed for two inches of fish, we need to double the amount of water per inch. That would be 2 * 1 gallon = 2 gallons of water per inch. Since there's only one dimension (length) for the fish in this tank, we can now calculate the number of fish: Number of fish = Total water volume / Water volume per fish = 16 gallons / 2 gallons/inch = 8 inches = 4 fish\\n2. In the first tank, we have three-inch fish. Using the same logic as above, we need 3 gallons of water per inch for these fish: Number of fish = Total water volume / Water volume per fish = 32 gallons / 3 gallons/inch = 11 inches = 11 fish\\n\\nNow, let's find out how many more fish Gail has in the first tank than the second tank: 11 fish - 4 fish = 7 fish.\\n\\nHowever, since we don't know whether one of the first tank fish eats another fish or not, we cannot include that information in our answer. The given information only tells us about the number of fish and their sizes, but it doesn't mention anything about them eating each other.   \n",
