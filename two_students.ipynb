We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow ones, so we have:\\n\\nx = 1.8 * Ten (yellow flowers)\\n\\nAnd we also know that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. So we have:\\n\\ny = 0.25 * (Ten + x)\\n\\nWe can now solve this system of equations to find the number of flowers for each color.\\n\\nApproach 2: Using Ratios\\nAnother way to approach this problem is by using ratios. We know that there are Ten yellow flowers, and the ratio between purple and yellow flowers is 1.8:1, and the ratio between green and (yellow + purple) flowers is 1:4. So we have:\\n\\n(Purple Flowers) : (Yellow Flowers) = 1.8 : 1\\n(Green Flowers) : (Total Flowers) = 1 : 4\\n\\nWe can cross-multiply to find the number of purple and green flowers based on the given information about yellow flowers:\\n\\n(1 * Total Flowers) : (1.8 * Ten) = (1 * Total Flowers) : (1 * x) : (1 * 4) : (1.8 * Ten)\\nTotal Flowers : x = 1 : 1.8 : 1 : 7.2\\n\\nTo find a common multiplier for all terms, we can divide both sides by their greatest common divisor (which is 1):\\n\\nTotal Flowers : x = 1 : 1.8 : 1 : 7.2  => Total Flowers : x = 1 : 1 : 1 : 6.6\\n\\nNow, we can use the information that there are Ten yellow flowers to find the number of purple and green flowers:\\n\\nTotal Flowers = 10 + x+y\\nx = 1.8 * 10 = 18\\ny = (Total Flowers - 10 - 18)/4 = 20\\n\\nSo, Approach 1 and Approach 2 both lead to the same result: Mark has a total of 38 flowers in his garden (10 yellow, 18 purple, and 10 green).\""
